I'm figuring out the duration of speech for a specific word count. At a typical speed of 150 words per minute, that's about 2.5 words per second, which translates the 21 words into roughly 8.4 seconds. If it were slower, at 130 words per minute, it would take 9.69 seconds. However, I'll stick with the 8.4 seconds as my final choice. I just need to present it clearly as ""Final Answer: 8.4."" Done!"
