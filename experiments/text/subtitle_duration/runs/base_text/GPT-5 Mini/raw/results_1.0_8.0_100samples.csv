It looks like I've been measuring the time it takes to say different word counts. For instance, I noticed that one set had 8 words taking 0.65 seconds per word, which seems inconsistent. Then I measured another time with 12 seconds for about 26 words, giving me roughly 2.17 words per second. Now, I’m figuring out a good estimate based on 30 words at around 2.2 words per second for a total of 13.6 seconds, but I think I’ll settle on 13.5 seconds."

I’m working on a speech duration estimate. The goal is to output a single number following ""Final Answer:"". I know that a typical speech rate is about 150 words per minute, translating to 2.5 words per second. I previously checked a text and confirmed the duration was accurate. Now, I need to apply the same rate to a new text and calculate the word count for my estimate. Let's get to it!**Counting words for duration**

I need to parse text and ignore punctuation to count the words. I'll list them out systematically, finding a total of 30 words in the provided text. With each word averaging about 2.5 words per second, this gives me a calculated speech duration of 12 seconds. Now, I'm debating whether to present that as ""12"" or ""12.0."" Since it aligns with previous formats I've seen, I'll go with ""Final Answer: 12.0"" to keep consistency."

I'm analyzing the duration of my responses: the second one was about 12 seconds for roughly 26 words, the third took 13 seconds for 24 words, including some ""mm-hmm"" sounds.

Right, I'm estimating the response time for outputting something. So if I have about 30 words and my previous rate was around 2.1 words per second, I calculate it and come up with roughly 14.3 seconds.

I'm counting words and considering the impact of fillers and pauses. So, I calculated the average words per second (wps) as about 1.88 due to the variability in the speech.
