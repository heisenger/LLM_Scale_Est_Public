I'm estimating that with pauses and fillers, the speaking speed is about 140 words per minute, which turns out to be around 14 seconds. The added time for ""Mm-hmm"" also contributes about 1.6 seconds, so I could round it to a final answer of about 14 seconds.

I need to follow the developer's instructions clearly: I should just produce a final answer in a specific format. The text is ""very blocky looking graphics on it. And you just"", which has about nine words. Considering an average speech rate of about 2.5 words per second, I can calculate the total time. Dividing 9 words by 2.5 gives me roughly 3.6 seconds, and I’ll round that for clarity.

I’m counting words and thinking about how long it takes to say them. I’ve got 30 words, plus those “Mm-hmm” hesitations. When I calculate everything—word count, rate of speech, and pauses—I estimate it’ll take around 15.5 seconds to say it all. I’ll round to one decimal since that seems fitting! I guess I’ll confirm my final answer: “Final Answer: 15.5.” This is interesting to analyze!"
