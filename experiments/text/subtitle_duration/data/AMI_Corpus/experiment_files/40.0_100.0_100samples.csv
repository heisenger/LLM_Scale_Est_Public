They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly seventy , five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote I . don't know anything Hmm beyond . what fancy means , but that's particularly of use to us I , think .

We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television so , i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do it , sends a message to the television saying change the channel change , the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings adjust , the brightness . Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does uh , how it works and , what the end-user is gonna want from this product . Um . Oh a , way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product um , and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of"

Yeah , but Yeah I think that . goes in with simplicity and ease of use really . But So we might you as well never . have to change the battery Yeah . .

This Mm-hmm is the . the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . And personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell we , need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot We . need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated . We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple not , overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal so , that you're not waving your remote around and Mm-hmm having to get frustrated . and go do it by hands .
