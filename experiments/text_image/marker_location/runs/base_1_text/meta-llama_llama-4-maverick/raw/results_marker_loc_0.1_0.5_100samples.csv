First, let's transcribe the given line:
|---------O----~----~~--------=--------- |

The line is represented by a series of characters, with ""|"" denoting the ends, ""O"" denoting the red dot, and other characters representing the noisy or irrelevant data.

Let's count the total number of characters between the ""|"" ends:
