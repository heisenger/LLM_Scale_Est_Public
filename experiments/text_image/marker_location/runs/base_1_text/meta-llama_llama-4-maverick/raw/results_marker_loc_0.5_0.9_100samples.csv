The given representation is:
|----------------------~- O=----.-.------|

First, let's identify the total length of the line. Counting the characters, we have 38 characters from the start to the end of the line.

The ""O"" is located at the 13th position (counting from 0). 

To estimate the position of ""O"", we calculate its relative position on the line. The line is considered to be from 0.0 to 1.0.

Position of ""O"" = (Index of ""O"") / (Total length - 1)
