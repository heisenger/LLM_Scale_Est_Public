## Step 1
First, we need to understand the scale of the line. The line is represented with various characters, but the key is understanding that it is divided into segments.


## Step 2
Count the total number of segments or characters that represent the line to estimate its total length. The line is |=--------O-----=-=----------- ------~---|.


## Step 3
Let's count the characters:
