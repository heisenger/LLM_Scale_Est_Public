To estimate the horizontal position of the center of the dot, we need to analyze the given text representation of the horizontal line and locate the dot marked as ""O"".

## Step 2
The given line is: | ------------- ----------O=-------- .---|

## Step 3
First, we count the total number of characters representing the line. The line is represented by ""-"" and other characters. We need to consider the characters that represent the line's length.

## Step 4
Let's count the characters: The total length is represented by the characters between ""|"" and ""|"". So, we count the ""-"" and other relevant characters.

## Step 5
