|---.- --------------.-------~ O---------|

First, we need to understand the scale. The line starts at 0.0 and ends at 1.0. We need to estimate where ""O"" is between these two points.


Let's break down the line:


1. The line starts with ""|---.-"", indicating some markings or divisions.
2. It continues with ""--------------"", a long straight line, suggesting a significant portion of the line.
3. Then, there's "".-------~"", which might indicate some sort of marking or slight deviation but is still part of the line.
4. ""O"" is the point"
