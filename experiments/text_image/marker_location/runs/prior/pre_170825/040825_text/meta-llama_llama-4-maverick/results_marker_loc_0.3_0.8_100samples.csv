There are 37 characters from | to |, not counting the last |. The 'O' is at the 19th position (counting the first '|' as 1).

## Step 2 is not needed as per the instructions.

The final answer is calculated based on the position of 'O'. The total count is 37 characters (including the first '|'), and 'O' is at the 19th position.
