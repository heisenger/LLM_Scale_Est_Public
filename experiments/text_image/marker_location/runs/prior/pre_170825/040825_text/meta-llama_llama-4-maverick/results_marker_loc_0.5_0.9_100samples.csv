First, we need to understand that the line is divided into segments represented by different parts of the string. Let's break it down:

1. The line starts with ""| "" which is not part of the length.
2. Then, there are ""-------------"" which represent the first segment of the line.
3. Followed by "" ----------O=-------- "" which includes the ""O"" we're interested in.
4. Lastly, there's "".---|"" at the end.
