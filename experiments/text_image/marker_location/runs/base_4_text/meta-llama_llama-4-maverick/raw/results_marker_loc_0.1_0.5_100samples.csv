The total length is 40 characters. ""O"" is at the 12th position (counting from 1, starting at the leftmost ""|"").

Since indexing starts at 1 for this count, we adjust it to be zero-indexed: 12 - 1 = 11.

The fraction of the line where ""O"" is located is 11 / (total length - 1) because we are considering the positions between characters.

Thus, the fraction = 11 / 39.
