The total length between ""|"" is 42 characters. ""O"" is at the 10th character.


So the position is calculated as: 10 / 42 = 0.238

The total length between ""|"" is 39 characters. ""O"" is at the 7th character.


So the position is calculated as: (7 - 0.5) / 39 = 6.5 / 39 = 0.167


Given the previous observations were in the range 0.1 to 0.3, this is within a reasonable range.
