Experiment
Phase 1: single factor ablation
    Base: noise (0), verbal steer (0), numerical steer (0), context (10), noise sequence (na), system prompt (task specific)
    Run it just for Anthropic first and then run for the rest

    Other settings unchanged unless otherwise stated
    Base_1 (VS): verbal steer (1) 
    Base_2 (NS): numerical steer (1)
    Base_3 (N): noise (1)
    Base_4 (C): context (3)
    Base_5 (NSeq): noise sequence (gradual)
    Base_6 (PS): prior steer (1)
    Base_7 (LC): Longer context
    Base_8 (RO): Reversed order of stimulus
