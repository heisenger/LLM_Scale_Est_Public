Line 1: |--=-------=------------------ | = 1 + 2 + 7 + 2 + 18 + 1 = 31 (non-space characters, but for simplicity, we can directly count the total length including spaces or just visually compare)


Line 1 length (visually): approximately 31


Line 2: |--------------------------- ------------| 


Line 2 length (visually): approximately 43 (as it appears longer)


Since Line 1 is approximately 31 units and Line 2 is approximately 43 units, the ratio of the shorter line (Line 1) to the longer line (Line 2) is"
