The first line's length is approximately the number of characters from the start to the ""~"" symbol, which is around 24 characters (including the starting ""|"").


The second line's length is approximately the number of characters from the ""="" symbol to the ""."" symbol, which is around 38 characters (including the starting ""|"").


Thus, the lengths are approximately 24 and 38.


The ratio of the shorter to the longer is 24 / 38.

The second line's length is represented similarly, from the '=' to the '.', which is about 34 characters.

Thus, the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line is 24/34.

Line 1: |--------------~~----------              |
- The total length is approximated by the sum of the parts represented by different characters. Assuming '-' and '~' represent equal units of length and ignoring the spaces for the initial estimation: 14 (for '-') + 2 (for '~') + 10 (for the remaining '-') = 26 units. However, there are trailing spaces, so the actual visual length is not fully utilized. Let's adjust our understanding to the visible representation.

The first line is represented as: |---------=--~--                         |
The second line is represented as: |---------------=---------=--------------|

Let's count the characters excluding the starting and ending '|':

1. For the first line: ---------=--~--                         |
   - --------- has 9 characters
   - = has 1 character
   - -- has 2 characters
   - ~ has 1 character
   - -- has 2 characters
   - The spaces after ""--"" until the ""|"" are counted as well. There are 25 spaces.
