To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given data. We are provided with a text-based representation of two lines and asked to estimate the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line.

### Step 2: Extract Line Lengths from the Given Representation
Let's analyze the given lines:
1. The first line is represented as `|--=------.---------                     |`. To estimate its length, we count the characters between the first and last '|', which gives us an approximate length.
2. The second line is `|-----------.----------------------------|`. Similarly, we count the characters between the first and last '|' to estimate its length.
