Let's count the characters for each line, assuming that the length is proportional to the number of characters.

Line 1: |-=-=----- | = 12 characters
Line 2: |-------------------------.------ -------| = 38 characters (including the '.')

To calculate the ratio, we divide the length of the shorter line by the length of the longer line.

Ratio = 12 / 38 = 0.3157894736842105

Rounding this to a reasonable number of decimal places gives us approximately 0.32.

Final Answer: 0.32"
