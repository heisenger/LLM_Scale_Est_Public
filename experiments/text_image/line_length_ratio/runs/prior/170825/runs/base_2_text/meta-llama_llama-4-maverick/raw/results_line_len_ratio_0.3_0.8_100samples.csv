The first line is represented as: |--=------.---------                     |
The second line is represented as: |-----------.----------------------------|

Let's count the characters representing the length of each line, excluding the '|' characters which seem to denote the start and end of the lines.

First line length: |--=------.---------                     |
- Counting from the first character after '|' to the last character before '|', we get: 
  - '--=------.---------                     ' = 43 characters (including '-' '=' '.' and spaces)

Second line length: |-----------.----------------------------|
- Similarly, counting: 
  - '-----------.----------------------------' = 43 characters (including '-'"

Line 1: |--=------.---------                     |
Counting the characters: 
- '|' appears twice, 
- '=' appears once, 
- '-' appears 7 times (in ""------"" and ""---------""), 
- '.' appears once.

However, to simplify, let's directly count the total length by ignoring the specific characters and just counting the total length:
1. |--=------.---------                     |
   |1234567890123456789                     |
   The length is approximately 38 (ignoring the exact count of special characters and considering the overall span).

2. |-----------.----------------------------|
