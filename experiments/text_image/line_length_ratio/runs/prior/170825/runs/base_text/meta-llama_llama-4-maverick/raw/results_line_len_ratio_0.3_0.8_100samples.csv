The first line is represented as |--=------.---------                     |. To count its length, we need to count the number of characters. Let's count them:

For the first line: |--=------.---------                     | 
Counting the characters gives us a total length of 3 + 8 + 9 + 21 = 41.

For the second line: |-----------.----------------------------| 
Counting the characters gives us a total length of 12 + 1 + 28 = 41.

However, upon closer inspection:
- The first line has 3 + 8 + 9 + 21 = 41 characters.
- The second line has 12 + 1 + 28 = 41 characters.

Both lines have the same length, 41.

Line 2: |-----------.----------------------------| has 47 characters (including the first and last '|').
