Line 1: |-=-=-----                               |
- The visible part before the whitespace is ""|-=-=-----"" which has 10 characters.
- Assuming the whitespace doesn't contribute to the length, and there's no more visible or significant part, we can approximate the length as around 10 units.

Line 2: |-------------------------.------ -------|
- This line contains 25 characters (including the '.').
- Thus, its length can be approximated as around 25 units.

The lengths are approximately 10 units and 25 units. The ratio of the shorter to the longer is"

For the first line: |-=-=-----                               | 
The length is approximately 20 characters (since the exact count is not necessary and some characters are placeholders or part of the representation).

For the second line: |-------------------------.------ -------| 
The length is approximately 40 characters.

Given these lengths, the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line is 20/40 = 0.5.

However, the given data is noisy and the previous observations were between 0.1 and 0.3. A simple ratio might not directly apply due to the noisy nature of the data.

Line 1: |-=-=----- |
Line 2: |-------------------------.------ -------| 

Let's count the characters in each line to estimate their lengths, ignoring any non-line characters like ""="" and ""."" for the sake of estimation, and focusing on the overall length.

Line 1 has approximately 11 characters.
Line 2 has approximately 37 characters (including the ""-"" and ignoring the ""."" and the space).

Now, comparing the lengths:
- The length of Line 1 is 11.
- The length of Line 2 is 37.

The shorter line is Line 1 with a length of 11,"
