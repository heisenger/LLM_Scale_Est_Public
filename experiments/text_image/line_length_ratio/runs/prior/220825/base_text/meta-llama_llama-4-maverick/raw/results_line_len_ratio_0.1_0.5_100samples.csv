Line 1: |-=-=-----                               |
Counting the characters: 
1. |
2. -
3. =
4. -
5. =
6. -----
7. (spaces)
8. |

Total characters that contribute to length: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 11 (ignoring spaces between = and - for simplicity, and not counting the trailing spaces as they don't contribute to the 'length' in a traditional sense)

Line 1: |-=-=----- | => The length can be considered as the number of characters representing the line, which is 11.

Line 2: |-------------------------.------ -------| => Similarly, the length is 38.

Now, comparing the two lengths: 
- Line 1 length = 11
- Line 2 length = 38

Since 11 is less than 38, the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line is 11/38.
