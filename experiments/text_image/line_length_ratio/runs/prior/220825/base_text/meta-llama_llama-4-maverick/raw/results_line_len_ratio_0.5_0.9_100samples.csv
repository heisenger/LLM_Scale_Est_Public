The first line is: ------------- ----------
The second line is: --------=---~---------------------------

Let's count the characters for each line to estimate their lengths.


First line length: 14 (for '-') + 1 (for ' ') + 10 (for '-') = 25 (approximately, considering the '-' and spaces as the main length contributors)
Second line length: 8 (for '-') + 1 (for '=') + 3 (for '-') + 1 (for '~') + 27 (for '-') = 40 (approximately)

Now, comparing the lengths: 
- The first line is approximately 25 units long.

Counting the characters between the `|` gives a total length.

For the second line: `|------------------------------ --- -----|`
Similarly, counting the characters between the `|` gives a total length.

First line length: 1 + 21 + 9 + 5 = 36 (not counting the boundary `|` and assuming the spaces at the end count towards its length, there are 5 spaces at the end, making it 41)

Line 1: | ------------- ----------               |
Length of Line 1 = 14 (since there are 14 characters between the '|')

Line 2: |--------=---~---------------------------|
Length of Line 2 = 40 (since there are 40 characters between the '|')


Length of Line 1 = 14
Length of Line 2 = 40

Since 14 is less than 40, Line 1 is the shorter line, and Line 2 is the longer line.

Ratio = Length of shorter line / Length of longer line = 14 / 40 = 0.35

Let's count the characters for each line to estimate their lengths.


Line 1 length: 14 (for ""-------------"") + 10 (for ""----------"") = 24
Line 2 length: 8 (for ""--------"") + 1 (for ""="") + 3 (for ""---"") + 1 (for ""~"") + 27 (for ""---------------------------"") = 40
