The first line is represented as |--=------.---------                     |, which has a total length of 53 characters (counting each character including spaces and symbols).


The second line is represented as |-----------.----------------------------|, which has a total length of 43 characters.


However, upon closer inspection, it seems the actual lengths should be visually estimated or directly counted including all characters.


Let's directly count:
1. |--=------.---------                     | = 53
2. |-----------.----------------------------| = 43


Since the task is to estimate the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line:

The first line is represented as |--=------.--------- and the second as |-----------.----------------------------|. 

Let's count the characters for each line, excluding the first character '|' which is common for both and represents the start of the line.

First line (excluding '|'): 
- '=' counts as 1 character
- '-' counts as 1 character each
- '.' counts as 1 character

So, for the first line: 
- '|' (not counted)
- '--' = 2
- '=' = 1
- '------' = 6
- '.' = 1
