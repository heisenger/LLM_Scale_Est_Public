Line 1: |--=------.---------                     |
- The total length can be considered by counting the characters within the '|': 
  - '|--=------.---------                     ' has 43 characters including the '|' at the ends, but we should not count the '|' as part of the length. So, the length is the count of characters between '|' which is 41.

Line 2: |-----------.----------------------------|
- Similarly, counting the characters within '|': 
  - '-----------.----------------------------' has 43 characters.

Let's count more precisely:
- Line 1 has 41 characters between '|'.

Let's count the characters representing the length of the lines:
- The first line is represented by: |--=------.---------                     |, which has a total length of approximately 47 characters (including the border '|').
- The second line is represented by: |-----------.----------------------------|, which has a total length of approximately 43 characters (including the border '|').

However, upon closer inspection, we see that the actual lengths are not just the total characters but should consider the visual representation. Let's re-evaluate:
- First line length = 4 (before '.') + 9 (after '.') + some spaces (let's count them)"
