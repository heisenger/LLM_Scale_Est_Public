Line 1: |-=-=----- |
- Counting the characters: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 11

Line 2: |-------------------------.------ -------| 
- Counting the characters: 1 + 25 + 1 + 6 + 7 + 1 = 41

The lengths are approximately 11 and 41. The shorter line is 11, and the longer line is 41.

The ratio = 11 / 41 ≈ 0.2683.

The lengths are approximately 20 and 42 (or 41, depending on interpretation, but 42 is used here for simplicity). The shorter line is 20, and the longer line is 42.
