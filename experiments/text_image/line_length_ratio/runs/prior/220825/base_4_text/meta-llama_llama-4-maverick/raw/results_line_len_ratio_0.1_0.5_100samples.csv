Line 1: |--- =--------                           |
- The length can be estimated by counting the characters that represent the line. Let's count: 
  - ""---"" is 3 characters
  - ""=--------"" is 8 characters (including the ""="" as part of the line representation)
  - There are trailing spaces but they don't count towards the line length.
  So, the total length is approximately 3 + 8 = 11 characters.

Line 2: |------.---------------------~-----------|
- Similarly, counting the characters:
  - ""------"" is 6 characters
  - ""---------------------"" is"
