Line 1: |--------=--------------                 |
- The line starts and ends with '|', which are not part of the length.
- Counting the characters between the '|': 8 (for --------) + 1 (for =) + 14 (for --------------) + 17 (spaces) = 40


Line 2: |-----------=------------- --------------|
- Similarly, counting the characters between the '|': 11 (for -----------) + 1 (for =) + 13 (for -------------) + 14 (for --------------) + 1 (space) = 40
