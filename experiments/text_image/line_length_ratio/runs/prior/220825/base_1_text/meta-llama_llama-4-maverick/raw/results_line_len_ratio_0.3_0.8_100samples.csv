The first line is represented as `|--=------.---------                     |`, and the second line is represented as `|-----------.----------------------------|`.

Let's count the characters in each line to estimate their lengths:

1. The first line has approximately 47 characters (including spaces and symbols).
2. The second line has approximately 43 characters (including symbols).

However, upon closer inspection, we see that the first line is actually longer when considering its visual representation on a typical terminal or text editor, but the character count is less due to the presence of spaces. The actual length or the visual length isn't directly proportional to the character count due to the varying widths"

2. |-----------.----------------------------| 

Let's analyze them:

1. The first line has a total of 3 segments (|--=------ and .--------- and the spaces/tail), but for length, we consider the entire span from the first ""|"" to the last ""|"". The actual length is estimated by counting the characters:

   - The remaining part until ""|"" has 21 characters (including the space and the last ""|"").

Let's analyze the lengths:

1. The first line has a total of 3 parts (before the '.', between '--=------' and '.', and after '.').

The part after '.' is '---------' which is 9 characters. So, the total length before and"
