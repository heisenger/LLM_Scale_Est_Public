The first line is represented as ""------------- ----------"" and the second line as ""--------=---~---------------------------"". To simplify, let's count the number of characters that make up the main body of each line, ignoring any non-line characters like ""="" and ""~"".

The first line appears to be approximately 16 characters long (counting the visible characters between the ""|"" symbols).
The second line appears to be approximately 36 characters long.


To estimate the ratio, I will divide the length of the shorter line by the length of the longer line.


Shorter line length = 16
Longer line length = 36


Ratio = Shorter / Longer = 16 / 36 = 0.4444


Rounded to a reasonable precision, the ratio is approximately 0.44.

Let's denote the length of the first line as $L_1$ and the length of the second line as $L_2$. By counting the characters representing the lines, we can approximate their lengths.

For the first line: `------------- ----------`
- Counting the hyphens and spaces gives us a total length. There are 13 hyphens and 2 spaces (between the hyphens and the word ""----------""), and 10 hyphens, making it 13 + 10 = 23 characters.

Let's examine the lines:

1. The first line is represented as `------------- ----------`. Let's count the characters that make up the line. Assuming the line is made up of the characters that are not spaces, we count the hyphens. There are 13 hyphens before the space and 8 after, but they are separated, so we might consider the total length as the sum of these or just visually assess. The total count is 13 + 8 = 21.
