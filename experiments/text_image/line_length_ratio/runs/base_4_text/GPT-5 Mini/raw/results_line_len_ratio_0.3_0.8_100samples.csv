I need to compute the ratio of lengths, focusing on characters inside the bars while ignoring spaces. For the first line, I find the characters between the bars: it's 14 dashes, 2 tildes, and 10 dashes, totaling 26 characters. 

For the second line, I’ll remove spaces and calculate again. The first segment gives me a total of 12 characters. Then, I need to count the dashes in the second segment, which shows 27 dashes. Let's ensure those counts are spot on!**Counting character segments**

I need to count accurately. I was uncertain about the total earlier. The characters in the second segment seem to total 27 dashes, which I can verify by counting them one by one. When I add that 27 to the first segment's total of 12, I get 39 for the second line. With the shorter line at 26 and the longer at 39, the ratio is 26/39, which simplifies to approximately 0.667. I'll finalize this as my answer: ""Final Answer: 0.667."""

I’m focusing on computing lengths while ignoring spaces. First, I'm counting the characters between the bars, including both lines. For the first line, there’s a series of 23 dashes before the symbols “-.”, giving a total of 26. The second line starts with 6 characters, then it seems like it has about 33 dashes which brings that total to 40. Okay, so the ratio I’m looking for is 26 divided by 40, resulting in 0.65."

For the second line, ""-------------------------------"", I realize I must first remove spaces, leading to ""-------------------------------"". Counting again gives 4 hyphens, 1 tilde, and 27 hyphens. I'm determining the ratio of the counts as 26/32 or 0.8125.**Calculating hyphen counts**

I'm considering an alternate approach to count the total characters visually in the second line: ""--.-------- ----------------------------"" including spaces. I realize that the first part has 11 characters, while the length between the bars seems to be around 40. I'll compare this to the first line, checking for consistent width. It looks like both bars are the same width, possibly around 41 characters total. This gives me a clearer idea of the relationship between spaces and non-space characters.**Verifying character widths**

Okay, I'm figuring out the total width, which I think should be 41 characters, with 1 space giving me 40 non-space characters. But I'm questioning if that total width really is 41, especially with line one having 17 trailing spaces to fill the width. 

If the total is 41 and there are 23 non-space characters, that means 18 spaces, which makes it consistent. With line two having 1 space, I've got non-space as 40, leading to the conclusion that 29 dashes are needed. After considering alignment and ratios, I plan to go with 0.575."

I'm counting the dashes in the line. I count by grouping them into bundles of five, which gives me 33 dashes in total. Then I add the count of five to get 39 and include the trailing dot, bringing the total to 40. So, the shorter length is 26, and the longer is 40, making the ratio 26/40, which equals 0.65. I'll output that without an explanation: ""Final Answer: 0.65."""

I need to compute lengths while ignoring spaces, counting characters between pipes for each line. 

For the first line, I extract and remove spaces. I find that the character count is 23, as I include every relevant character.

In the second line, I do the same, and after some careful counting, I realize the number of dashes comes to 28. It’s good to double-check these numbers to be accurate!**Counting character lengths**

I’m counting characters for the first group, which adds up to 11. For the second group, I carefully count the dashes, totaling 28. Combining these, I find the lengths are 23 and 39. When I look for a ratio, it’s 23 divided by 39, which gives me a decimal of approximately 0.5897435897. 

I’ll stick to the guidelines and provide just the final answer, formatted nicely with 10 decimal places."
