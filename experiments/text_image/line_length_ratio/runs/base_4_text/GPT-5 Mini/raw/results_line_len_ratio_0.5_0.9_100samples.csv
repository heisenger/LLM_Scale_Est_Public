I’m focusing on counting characters within each bar while ignoring spaces. For Line 1, I see two leading spaces, then I clean it up to count: there are 13 hyphens in the first segment and 10 in the second, which gives a total of 23 hyphens combined. In Line 2, there’s no need to remove spaces. I count it carefully and see there are 8, then 1, 3, 1, and finally some hyphens; it looks like around 27. I'll count precisely!**Calculating ratios of hyphens**

I need to count the number of hyphens visually in the line, which seems to be around 27. I'll compare the total lengths: Line 1 is 23 and Line 2 adds up to 40.

I need to compute the lengths of strings while ignoring spaces. For the first line, I'll count characters between the tildes. The content is ""-----------------------------"" and removing spaces gives me ""-----------------------------"". 

Now, counting shows 1 tilde at the start, then I see 28 dashes, followed by another tilde and a dash at the end. If I keep track, that adds up to 31 characters total. For the next line, I'll repeat this process.**Counting characters again**

So, I'm looking at the second line, which starts with a dot followed by three dashes and a space, then I suspect there are 35 dashes after that. If I remove the spaces, it becomes "".-------"". That gives me 4 so far with the dot and dashes. After the space, I'll confirm if there are indeed 35 dashes. 

Using a method of visual counting seems necessary here, so I'm considering the ratio of lengths between the first and second lines, which might help me compare them accurately. Let’s recount that first dash line carefully as well!**Calculating ratios and totals**

I’m marking the counts for dashes in groups to ensure accuracy. For the first line, I counted 28 dashes accurately between the tildes, giving me a total of 31 characters once I added the side tildes. 

Now, for the second line, after removing spaces, it looks like there are 39 characters in total — combining the dot, three dashes, and 35 dashes. The ratio of the first line (31) to the second line (39) gives me approximately 0.795 when rounded to three decimals. Final answer: 0.795."

For the second line, after removing spaces, I start with two hyphens, then it seems like there are 32 hyphens before four more. I'm confirming the middle section, which looks tricky to count correctly.**Calculating ratios and counts**

I need to confirm the length for the second line, which ends with four hyphens. I think the total length might be 2 (from the start) plus 32 (the middle) plus 4, giving me 38. The longer section is 38, while the shorter is 21, resulting in a ratio of 21/38, which is about 0.553.

I need to count non-space characters between bars for each line, ignoring spaces and punctuation. Starting with the first line, I see it shows spaces interspersed with hyphens and a tilde. After removing the spaces, I count the characters: six hyphens, one tilde, and eleven additional dashes, totaling nineteen characters. The second line has no spaces but a mix of dashes and periods, and I estimate it’s about forty-three characters long. I'll verify those counts for precision.**Counting dashes for accuracy**

I need to count the dashes in the string ""---------------------------."" It looks like there are twenty-seven dashes, which I can verify by grouping them into threes.

I've got to compute lengths between bars while ignoring spaces. For the first line, I see there are 21 characters after removing the spaces. The second line looks like it might have 32 dashes. Let me double-check: the string has ""--"" followed by a long sequence of dashes and ends with ""----"". I've got to count them correctly. My reasoning suggests there are indeed 32 characters. I’ll ensure to count carefully just in case!**Counting character segments**

I’m checking how many characters are in the segment. I suspect there are 32 dashes in the middle. If that’s correct, the total for the second line would be 38 when I add the two at the start and four at the end. The first line has 21 characters, giving a ratio of about 0.55263 when I divide 21 by 38. So, I’ll present it as ""Final Answer: 0.55263"" without over-explaining."

I need to compute the length of characters inside bars, ignoring spaces. For the first line, it looks like I have the string ""-----------------------------"" which contains a tilde and many dashes. After counting meticulously, I find there are 1 tilde at the start, 28 dashes, and another tilde and dash for a total of 31 characters in this line. So the first line length is 31.**Calculating second line length**

For the second line, I have the string "".--- -----------------------------------."" I see there's a leading dot and three dashes followed by spaces and many dashes. Ignoring spaces, the first part gives me 4 characters. Counting the dashes, I get 33 using groups, so the total for this line is 37 characters. Now, comparing the lengths, I find the ratio of 31 to 37, which is approximately 0.8378. So, I'll present my final answer as:

I need to count the lengths of two lines while ignoring spaces. The first line is made up of dashes and characters, and I’ll count them carefully to ensure accuracy. I see there are 10 dashes in the first part, and then 9 dashes plus some other characters leads to a total of 21. For the second line, it starts with two dashes, followed by what looks like 32 dashes, and ends with four more—so I’ll sum those up for the final count.**Calculating the lengths and ratio**

I want to count the middle dashes, which visually appear as 32 dashes. I’ll count them carefully in groups—10, then another 10, and finally two more gives me a total of 32. Now, for the second line, I combine this with the earlier counts: it starts with 2 dashes, has 32 in the middle, and ends with 4, giving me a total length of 38. The shorter length is 21, and the ratio comes to about 0.55. So, I'll report just the ratio as my final answer."
