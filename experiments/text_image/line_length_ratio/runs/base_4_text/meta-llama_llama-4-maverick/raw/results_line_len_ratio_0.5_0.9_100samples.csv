First line: |--=-------=------------------           |
Removing spaces and vertical bars: |--=-------=------------------
Length: 1 + 2 + 7 + 2 + 18 = 30 (ignoring the trailing spaces)

Second line: |--------------------------- ------------|
Removing spaces and vertical bars: |--------------------------- ------------
Length: 27 + 12 = 39 (there are 27 '-' and 12 '-')

Now, comparing the two lengths: 
- Length of the first line = 30
- Length of the second line = 39

Line 1: |---------=-----------------~---| has characters: ---------=-----------------~--- (total 28 characters)
Line 2: |------=------=--------------------------| has characters: ------=------=-------------------------- (total 38 characters)

Since 28 is less than 38, the ratio is 28/38.

28/38 = 0.7368...
