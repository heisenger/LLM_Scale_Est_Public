First, let's extract the line representations:
1. |--=------.---------                     |
2. |-----------.----------------------------| 

Now, let's remove the vertical bars (|) and count the non-space characters in each line.

1. --=------.---------                     
   After removing '|', we have: --=------.---------                     
   Non-space characters count: 
   - '--=------.---------' gives us 2 + 6 + 1 = 9 characters.

2. -----------.----------------------------   
   After removing '|', we have: -----------.----------------------------

Line 1: |--=------.---------                     |

Line 2: |-----------.----------------------------|
- Removing spaces and counting characters: |-----------.----------------------------| = 1+11+1+28 = 41

Now, comparing the lengths: Line 1 is 21 units, and Line 2 is 41 units. Line 1 is shorter.

The ratio of the shorter line to the longer line = 21 / 41 = 0.5122.

The shorter line is Line 1 with a length of 16, and the longer line is Line 2 with a length of 39.

The ratio of the shorter line to the longer line = 16 / 39 = 0.41.

1. Remove the vertical bars and any space characters from the given line representations.
2. Calculate the length of each line after removing the spaces.
3. Determine the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line.

Let's process the given lines:

Line 1: |--=------.---------                     |
- Removing the vertical bars and spaces: --=------.---------
- Length: counting the characters without spaces, we get 2 (for --) + 7 (for ------) + 1 (for .) + 9 (for ---------) = 19
