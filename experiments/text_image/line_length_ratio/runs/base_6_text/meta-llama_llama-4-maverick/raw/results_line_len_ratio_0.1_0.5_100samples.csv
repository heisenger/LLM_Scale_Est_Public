Length of Line 1 = 9
Length of Line 2 = 30

Since 9 is less than 30, the shorter line is 9 and the longer line is 30.

Ratio = shorter line / longer line = 9 / 30 = 0.3

Rounding it to two decimal places is not required as per the format, hence 
0.46 is the right value. The final answer is: 0.46. Rewritten as per format: 
0.46 -> The value is already calculated.
