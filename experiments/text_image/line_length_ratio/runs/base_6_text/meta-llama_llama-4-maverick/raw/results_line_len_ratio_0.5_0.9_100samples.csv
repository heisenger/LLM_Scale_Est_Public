Line 1: `| ------------- ----------               |`
- Removing spaces and vertical bars: `------------- ----------`
- Counting non-space characters: `13 + 8 = 21`

Line 2: `|--------=---~---------------------------|`
- Removing spaces and vertical bars: `--------=---~---------------------------`
- Counting non-space characters: `34`

Now, comparing the lengths: Line 1 is 21 units, and Line 2 is 34 units. Line 1 is shorter.

The ratio of the shorter line to the longer line is `21 / 34`.

Calculating the ratio: `21 / 34",

For the first line: | ------------- ----------               |

For the second line: |--------=---~---------------------------|
- Removing spaces and counting: ""--------=---~---------------------------"" gives us 36 characters.

Now, we determine the lengths: 
- Length of the first line = 27

Line 1: |---------=-----------------~---         |
Non-space characters count = 29

Line 2: |------=------=--------------------------| 
Non-space characters count = 34

Shorter line length = 29
Longer line length = 34

Ratio = 29 / 34 = 0.853

Final Answer: 0.68",
