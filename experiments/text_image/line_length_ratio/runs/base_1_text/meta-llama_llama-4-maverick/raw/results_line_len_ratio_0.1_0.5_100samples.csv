Line 1: |-=-=-----                               |
 Cleaning: removing ""|"" and spaces, we get ""-=-=-----"" which has a length of 8.

Line 2: |-------------------------.------ -------| 
 Cleaning: removing ""|"" and spaces, we get ""-------------------------.-------------"" which has a length of 34 (including the ""."").

Now, comparing the lengths: Line 1 has 8 characters and Line 2 has 34 characters. Line 1 is shorter.

The ratio of the shorter line to the longer line = length of Line 1 / length",

Line 1: |-=-=-----                               |
- Removing spaces and counting: |-=-=-----| = 8 characters

Line 2: |-------------------------.------ -------|
- Removing spaces and counting: |-------------------------.------| = 30 characters (including the '.')

Now, comparing the two lengths:
- Line 1 length = 8
- Line 2 length = 30

The ratio of the shorter line to the longer line is 8/30.

Calculating the ratio: 8 / 30 = 0.26666667

Line 1: |------------.-~----                     |
- Removing spaces: |------------.-~----| = 19 characters

Line 2: |-------------.~-------------------------|
- Removing spaces: |-------------.~-------------------------| = 31 characters

Now, comparing the two lengths:
- Line 1 length = 19
- Line 2 length = 31

The ratio of the shorter line to the longer line is 19/31.

Calculating the ratio: 19 / 31 = 0.61290323

To calculate: 
Line 1 length: 13 + 1 (for the first |) + 1 (for the last |) - 2 (for the spaces, there are none but | is included) = 14 - 2 = 12 (ignoring spaces) or simply counting non-space characters: 13.
Line 2 length: 18.

Ratio = 13 / 18 = 0.722.

The final answer is not 0.722. To directly give the final answer for the given representation.

The representation is |-=-=-----~--~--~--~-| and |-----~--~~-",
