For the first line: `| ------------- ----------               |`
- Removing spaces and vertical bars, we get: `------------- ----------`
- Counting the characters, we have: `13 + 10 = 23`

Line 1: |--- ---------------------.---------     |
Non-space characters count: 1+ --------------------- (ignoring spaces) = 21

Line 2: |------------------------------ --- -----|
Non-space characters count: |------------------------------ (38) +  (5, ignoring the space) = 43

Now comparing them:
Line 1 length: approximately 21 characters
Line 2 length: approximately 43 characters

The ratio is 21/43 = 0.488.

The final answer is 0.488.
