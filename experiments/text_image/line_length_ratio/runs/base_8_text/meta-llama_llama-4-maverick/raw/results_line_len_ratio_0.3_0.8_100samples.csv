For the first line: |-----------------------~-.              |
- Removing spaces and counting characters inside the vertical bars: |-----------------------~-.| = 25 characters

For the second line: |-----=---------------------------------.|
- Removing spaces and counting characters inside the vertical bars: |-----=---------------------------------.| = 41 characters

Since 25 is less than 41, the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line is 25/41.

25/41 = 0.60975609756

Rounded to a simple decimal representation, we consider it as 0.61.
