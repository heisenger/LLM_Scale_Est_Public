Line 1: |--=-------=------------------           |
Removing spaces: |--=-------=------------------|
Length: 1 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 18 = 28


Line 2: |--------------------------- ------------|
Removing spaces: |---------------------------------------|
Length: 27 + 12 = 39 (or simply count the non-space characters)


Since 28 is less than 39, the ratio is 28 / 39 = 0.7179487179.

- Counting characters (excluding '|'): 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 22 = 36

Line 1 length = 30

Line 1: |--=-------=------------------           |
Non-space characters: |--=-------=------------------
Count: 1 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 18 = 28
