Alright, I need to evaluate the character ratio between two lines, ignoring spaces. For the first line, I count 14 hyphens, 2 tildes, and 10 more hyphens for a total of 26. In the second line, I get 12 from the first part and 27 from the hyphens, leading to a total of 39. So, the ratio of the shorter to the longer line is 26/39, which simplifies to about 0.6667. I'll provide that as the final answer."

I need to compute the lengths of specific strings while ignoring spaces. First, I’ll check Line 1: “------------” has 12 hyphens plus one tilde, making that 13 characters.

I need to count characters excluding spaces to find lengths between bars. For the first line, I'm looking at ""------------,"" which has 12 hyphens and one tilde for a total of 13. 

Then for the second line, ""----------.------------.----------------,"" the counts add up to 40, which I calculated carefully! 

So, I've got a ratio between the lengths of 13 and 40, which gives me 0.325. My output format will be: ""Final Answer: 0.325"" with no extras."

I'm figuring out how to count non-space characters between bars in specific lines. For the first line, I can see I'll remove spaces and then count the characters. I counted 14 hyphens and 2 tildes, which gives a total of 26. For the second line, after removing spaces, it seems I've found 12 characters initially, and then I'll carefully count the hyphens in the next segment to total 27, making it 39 for that line.**Calculating the ratio**

I'm calculating a ratio based on the lengths of two values: 26 and 39. When I divide 26 by 39, I get approximately 0.666666..., which seems to round nicely to 0.66667 for clarity. According to the instructions, I need to format this correctly. So, I'll present the final answer like this: ""Final Answer: 0.66667"".

I need to figure out the lengths of characters between bars, excluding spaces. For the first line, I see that there are 12 dashes and 1 tilde, which totals 13. The second line looks a bit more complex: I've counted and found there are 40 characters total. So, I establish that the shorter is 13 and the longer is 40. The ratio is 13 divided by 40, which gives me 0.325. I think I’ll format the output as ""Final Answer: 0.325""."

I need to compute lengths while ignoring spaces. For the first line, the counted characters before spaces total to 15. The breakdown is 9 dashes, plus one equals sign, two more dashes, one tilde, two dashes. For the second line, I think I should tally up the characters again: 15 dashes, one equal sign, 9 dashes, another equals sign, and 14 dashes gives a total of 40. Thus, the ratio ends up being 0.375.

I'm working through how to count characters between pipes, excluding spaces. For the first line, “------------------------,” it looks like there are 26 characters total—14 dashes and 2 tildes getting added to 10 more dashes. 

For the second line, “----------- ---------------------------,” I find 39 characters after removing spaces. Adding these segments gives me a total of 39, and then I need to calculate the ratio of 26 to 39, which comes out to approximately 0.667."
