I need to count non-space characters between the vertical bars for each line, ignoring spaces. For the first line, I see ""-----"" with a length of 5 after removing spaces.

I need to calculate the number of characters ignoring spaces, focusing on the two lines provided.

For Line 2: ""|-------------------------.------ -------|"", there’s a space between '------' and '-------', but I’ll ignore that space in my count.**Counting non-space characters**

I'm focused on counting non-space characters from the line ""-------------------------.------ -------."" Removing spaces gives me ""-------------------------.--------------"". I realize I need to be careful, as the original has a dot after 25 dashes, followed by a space and a couple of groups of dashes. 

After counting, I determine that there are 25 dashes before the dot, then 6 after it, plus another 7. Altogether, I get a total of 39 non-space characters, leading to a ratio of 9/39."

I’m figuring out how to count the lengths while ignoring spaces, and it’s tricky with two lines between pipes. For the first line, I see ""------ ------.-"" with a lot of spaces after it. After removing spaces, I expect it to be ""------ ------.-"", which breaks down into two segments: ""------"" and ""------.-"". Upon examining the second segment more closely, I realize it combines to 14 characters when I add everything up correctly. That's a total length of 14 characters.**Calculating line length**

For the second line, the content appears as ""---------------------------- ----------,"" with a space between groups. I need to remove spaces and look at the parts carefully. The first chunk has 18 hyphens, then comes """" followed by another 10 hyphens and another 10 hyphens after that. 

So the total adds up to 39 characters. Comparing this to the earlier count of 14 gives a ratio of 0.359. I’ll format it as ""Final Answer: 0.359"" without extra text."

I need to compute lengths while ignoring spaces. For the first line, I have '--- =--------' which becomes '---=--------'; that gives me 12 characters.

I'm trying to count the dashes after the equals sign in a sequence, plus some surrounding characters. It looks like I need to figure out the total characters between bars by evaluating the original line. I see five dashes followed by an equal sign, and there are more dashes leading up to a dot. Based on visual estimates, there might be 33 dashes in total, but I want to confirm by counting manually in groups. It's a bit tricky, so I'll compare proportions and look for patterns from earlier examples.**Counting dashes for accuracy**

I see I need to count the characters between the equals sign and the dot. Looking visually, there seem to be 33 dashes total. I'll double-check this by going through each position and marking them: from 1 to 33. That gives me a clearer idea. If I confirm n equals 33, then my total length calculation would be 7 plus 33, giving me 40. The ratio comes out to 16 divided by 40, which is 0.4. So, I'll finalize my answer as ""Final Answer: 0.4."""

I’m thinking about rounding the ratio to three decimals, which gives me 0.132, but that seems a bit too specific. I could simplify it to 0.1316, but I believe two decimals would be better, so I’ll go with 0.13. It aligns with previous examples like 0.15 and 0.4, which were also rounded to two decimal places.

I need to compute the lengths of lines while ignoring spaces. For the first line, I find that ""------------"" has 12 characters, and "".-"" consists of 3 characters, with the total coming to 19. Moving to the second line, I count ""-------------"", which is 13 characters, and ""."" adds 2 more, making 15. Then there are 25 trailing dashes, giving a final sum of 40. The ratio of the two lengths is 0.475. I’ll output ""Final Answer: 0.475"" without anything extra."

I'm figuring out how to count characters while ignoring spaces. I have two lines to analyze, starting with ""|-=-=-----                               |"". The non-space characters sum to 9. I catch that I need to check the second line, line ""|-------------------------.------ -------|"". After removing spaces, I'm counting hyphens and need to get the exact figures: the first group has 25 hyphens, then I need to monitor the other segments as well. It’s quite the intricate process!**Calculating character ratios**

I'm working through some calculations. I see that when I remove spaces, I get a total of 39 by adding segments of characters after the dot. So, using a ratio with the shorter count of 9 gives me about 0.23076923076923078. First, I double-check that 9 is indeed the correct count for “-=-=-----.” Everything looks good, and the output format needs to be: ""Final Answer: <number>"", keeping the decimal precise! I'll go ahead and output that."

I'm counting characters excluding spaces and checking lengths inside the bars. The first line gives me a character count of 6 for the sequence ""---.-."" after ignoring spaces.

I need to compute the ratio of shorter to longer lengths. So, it's 9 divided by long_count. To find long_count, I see there are 6 hyphens plus 7 more, making 13 additional characters to account for. The visual clue shows another 25 dashes before the dot, bringing the total to 39. Therefore, the ratio is 9 divided by 39, which simplifies to about 0.2308 when I round it. My final output will just be: ""Final Answer: 0.2308."""
