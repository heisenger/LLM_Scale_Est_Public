First, let's count the non-space characters in each line:

   - For the first line:  
     `|-----------------------~-.|`  
     There are **24** non-space characters.

   - For the second line:  
     `|-----=---------------------------------.|`  
     There are **33** non-space characters.

2. Identify the shorter and longer lines:
   - Shorter line: 24 characters.
   - Longer line: 33 characters.

3. Calculate the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Shorter line length}}{\text{Longer line length}} = \frac{2",
