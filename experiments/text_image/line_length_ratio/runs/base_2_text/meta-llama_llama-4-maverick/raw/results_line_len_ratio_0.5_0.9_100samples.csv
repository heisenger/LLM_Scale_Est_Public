Removing spaces: |------------- ----------|
Characters: | (1) + 14 +  (1) + 10 + (1) = 27

Line 2: |--------=---~---------------------------|
Removing spaces: Same as original since there are no spaces within the line representation.
Characters: | (1) + 8 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 27 + (1) = 42

Line 1 length = 27
Line 2 length = 42

Since 27 is less than 42, the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line = 27 / 42.
