- Removing spaces and counting: |--=------.---------| = 18 characters

Line 2: |-----------.----------------------------| 
- Removing spaces and counting: |-----------.----------------------------| = 33 characters

Line 1 length = 18
Line 2 length = 33

Since 18 is less than 33, the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line is 18/33.

18/33 = 0.545454...

Rounded to a reasonable decimal representation, the ratio is approximately 0.55.

1. For the first line: |--=------.---------                     |

The ratio is the length of the shorter line (29) divided by the length of the longer line (40), so 29/40 = 0.725.

Non-space characters count: 1 + 1 + 16 + 1 + 6 = 25 (ignoring spaces)

Line 2: |------=- -------------------------------|
Non-space characters count: 6 + 1 + 1 + 31 = 39 (ignoring spaces)

Since 25 is less than 39, the ratio is 25/39 = 0.641025641.
