Line 1: |-=-=-----                               |
- Removing spaces, we have: |-=-=-----|
- Counting the characters excluding '|', we get: -=--=-=----- = 8 characters

Line 2: |-------------------------.------ -------| 
- Removing spaces, we have: |-------------------------.------|-------|
- Counting the characters excluding '|', we get: |-------------------------.------ ------- = 27 characters

Line 1 length = 8
Line 2 length = 27

Since 8 is less than 27, the ratio of the shorter line to the longer line is 8/27.

Line 2: |------------------=-------------.-------|
Count without spaces: 19 + 1 + 14 + 1 = 35

Ratio = 5 / 35 = 0.1429 (approximately)

The final answer is: 0.14
