1. **Track the cumulative movement in the west-east (X-axis) and north-south (Y-axis) directions.**
2. **Sum up all the movements to determine the final position relative to the starting point.**
3. **Calculate the Euclidean distance using the final coordinates.**

### Step 1: Track Movements
We will keep track of the cumulative displacements in the X and Y directions.

#### Initial Position:
- Start at (0, 0).

#### Step-by-Step Movements:
1. **Take 1.0 units west**:

Then, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the Euclidean distance.

### Step 1: Analyze the path
The path is described as a series of movements in the cardinal directions (west, east, north, south). We'll track the net displacement in the west-east and north-south directions.

#### Horizontal Displacement (West-East):
