### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Initialize coordinates**:
   - Start at (0, 0).

2. **Follow the path and update coordinates**:
   - **Take 0.25 units north**:
     - New position: (0, 0.25).
   - **Take 0.25 units west**:
     - New position: (-0.25, 0.25).
   - **Take 0.2"

We will track the net movement in the north-south direction (N/S) and the east-west direction (E/W).

#### Initial Position:
- Start at \((0, 0)\).

#### Follow the Path:
1. **Take 0.25 units north**:
