To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and end of the path, we need to analyze the given text description step by step.

## Step 2
Let's break down the movements described:
1. Take 0.5 units west
2. Take 0.25 units south
3. Take 0.25 units east
4. Take 0.25 units south
5. Take 0.25 units west
6. Take 0.25 units south
7. Take 0.5 units west
8. Take 0.25 units north
9. Take 0.75 units west
10. Take 0.25 units south
11. Take 0."

The path is described in a series of steps involving movements in the cardinal directions (west, east, south, north).

## Step 2: Break down the movements into their vector components
To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and the end of the path, we need to sum the movements in the x (east-west) and y (north-south) directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the total movement in the x-direction
The movements in the x-direction are as follows:
- Take 0.5 units west = -0.5
- Take 0.25 units east = +0.25
- Take 0.25 units west = -"

The problem asks to estimate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and the end of a given path within a square boundary.

## Step 2: Break down the given path into its vector components.
To find the Euclidean distance, we need to calculate the net displacement in the x (east-west) and y (north-south) directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the net displacement in the x-direction.
The path involves movements in the west and east directions. West is considered negative, and east is considered positive.
- Take 0.5 units west = -0.5
- Take 0.25 units east = -0.5 + "

The path is described in a series of steps with directions and distances.

## Step 2: Break down the movements into their vector components
To calculate the final position relative to the start, we need to sum the movements in the x (east-west) and y (north-south) directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the total movement in the x-direction
The movements in the x-direction are: -0.5 (west), +0.25 (east), -0.25 (west), -0.5 (west), +0.75 (west), -0.25 (west), -0.25 (west). Summing these gives: -0"
