The path description is given as a series of directions and distances.

## Step 2: Break down the path into its north-south and east-west components
To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and the end of the path, we need to calculate the total displacement in the north-south and east-west directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the total northward and southward movement
Northward movements: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 1.5 + 0.25 = 1.0 + 1.5 (initial 4 steps and last step before southward movements) = 2.75"
