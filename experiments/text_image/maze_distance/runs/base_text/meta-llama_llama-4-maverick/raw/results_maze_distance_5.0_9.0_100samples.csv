The given text describes a path within a square boundary with a series of movements in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

## Step 2: Break down the movements
To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and end of the path, we need to calculate the net displacement in the x (east-west) and y (north-south) directions.

## Step 3: Calculate net displacement in the x-direction
Let's sum the west and east movements:
- West movements: 1.0 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 1.25 + 0.25 +"
