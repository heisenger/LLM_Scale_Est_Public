I need to compute net displacement and Euclidean distance, starting at (0,0). I've defined east as +x and north as +y. As I go through the movements step by step, I end up at the final coordinates of (-2.0, 2.75). Now, to calculate the distance, I use the formula: distance = sqrt((-2)^2 + (2.75)^2). After some calculations, I check if the distance is around 3.4, which seems to match but may need closer verification since it appears to deviate slightly.**Finalizing distance calculation**

I'm diving into the exact calculations again. I see that 11.5625 can be broken down as (3.4)^2 plus a small amount of around 0.0025. The derivative gives me 6.8, and by estimating, I find an approximation of about 3.400367. But could it be exactly 3.4? Flipping through some more calculations, I confirm that the distance is approximately 3.400368 when I calculate sqrt(185) divided by 4.

I'm focusing on computing the displacement from the starting point to the endpoint. I need to track the x-axis as positive for east and the y-axis as positive for north. This seems like a straightforward approach, but I want to make sure I'm getting this right. Sometimes it's easy to mix directions, so I'll take my time to ensure I track everything correctly while maintaining a clear understanding of the coordinate system.**Summing coordinates**

I've laid out the steps for displacement calculations by tracking my movement in x (east) and y (north) directions. For each movement, I need to adjust the coordinates accordingly, like subtracting when moving south and adding when heading north or east. After all these adjustments, I plan to sum up the x-values starting from zero and add the increments step by step. I want to stay focused and avoid making mistakes in this calculation.**Calculating distance**

I’m finalizing the x and y coordinates now. After adding up all the increments, I found that the final x is 3.75 and the final y is 2.25. Now, to calculate the distance, I’ll use the formula \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). I've computed the squares and summed them to get 19.125, which leads me to take the square root. I'm checking my calculations diligently, making sure I'm approximating and refining my result accurately. I want to ensure precision!**Finalizing the calculation**

I’ve figured out that 19.125 can be expressed as \( \frac{153}{8} \). To find the square root, I'll simplify it as \( \frac{\sqrt{153}}{\sqrt{8}} \). That further breaks down to \( \frac{\sqrt{153}}{2 \cdot \sqrt{2}} \). I've calculated \( \sqrt{153} \) to be approximately 12.369316, which I then divided by around 2.828427. This gives me about 4.373165. Now I just need to format my final answer correctly!"

I need to compute the net displacement by following the sequence of compass directions, starting from (0,0). I'll track the changes in x (east) and y (north) coordinates. After going through the given moves, I end up at the final position of (0.25, -4.0). To find the distance, I’ll apply the distance formula, which gives me a final answer based on my calculations.

I need to calculate the distance from the origin using the formula, and it looks like I got to the approximate value of 4.007. I want to compute it accurately, so I’ll recalculate the square root of 16.0625. It turns out, when I break it down, I can express it as sqrt(257) divided by 4. That makes my final computation yield 4.00780488547035, so I'll use this formatted output.

I need to compute the net displacement vector, where positive values indicate east (x) and north (y). Starting from the origin makes sense since it gives me a clear reference point. It sounds straightforward, but I want to make sure all the components and directions are correct as I work through this. I’ll keep in mind the established coordinate system, so I can accurately determine the net displacement. Let’s get started!**Listing steps for displacement calculation**

I need to outline my steps for calculating displacement. Starting with the movements, it appears I am first moving south by 0.5, updating my y-coordinate. Then I’ll move east by 0.25, which updates the x-coordinate. It continues in a similar pattern, adjusting the coordinates for each direction, either moving north, south, east, or west, until I finish with the final displacement values. I’ll make sure to keep track of these calculations clearly!**Calculating final coordinates and distance**

I’ve reached the final coordinates of x = 3.75 and y = 2.25. To find the distance, I need to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of these coordinates: \( \sqrt{(3.75^2 + 2.25^2)} \). First, I’ll compute \( 3.75^2 = 14.0625 \) and \( 2.25^2 = 5.0625 \), adding them together for a sum of \( 19.125 \). Using a precise calculation, I find that the distance is approximately \( 4.373537 \). I’ll present this final answer clearly!"

This involves summing the east-west coordinates, which should be positive for east, and the north-south coordinates, with positive values for north. This should give me a clear representation of the total displacement in both directions. It's a straightforward calculation, but I want to ensure I get the signs right for each direction!**Tracking the path's coordinates**

I need to calculate the x coordinate based on the path taken through multiple steps. Starting from 0, I progressively adjust the x value. First, I add 0.25 for east, then subtract for west movements, ensuring I track it accurately after each action. After step 6, I confirm that x equals -1.25, before checking the next steps for accuracy. I want to make sure everything adds up correctly as I finalize the calculations!**Calculating final coordinates**

I’m working through the calculation for y now. Starting from 0, I'm adding all the northward movements, which should total about +2.75. To double-check, I list each step and sum them carefully. After that, I move on to finding the displacement vector which is (-2.0, +2.75). Then I calculate the Euclidean distance using the formula, but I need to be cautious with the square root calculation. It seems like I got a value close to 3.4, but I want to confirm it’s accurate.**Refining the square root calculation**

I'm trying to pinpoint the exact square root of 11.5625, which initially seems like it could be 3.4 or maybe even something like 3.401. I notice that 3.4 squared gives me 11.56, and that’s close but not quite right. After doing some more precise calculations, I approximate the square root to be around 3.4003676. When I provide the final answer, I’ll keep the precision in mind, aiming for something like 3.400368 to make it clear and useful for the user!"

I need to compute the net displacement, starting from the origin (0,0). First, I’ll sum the movements east and west, keeping positive values for east. Then, I’ll sum the north and south movements, with positive values for north. After that, I can use the results to calculate the Euclidean distance from the starting point to the endpoint. It seems straightforward, so let’s get started on the calculations!**Tracking movement sequence**

I need to follow a sequence of movements starting from the origin. First, I'll move 0.5 units south, adjusting y to -0.5. Then, I'll head 0.25 east, adjusting x to 0.25. Continuing, I’ll make several movements north and east, updating both x and y coordinates along the way. I’ll keep updating these coordinates until I reach the final position. This systematic approach ensures I track everything accurately; let's see where I end up!**Calculating final distance**

I reached final coordinates of (3.75, 2.25). Now, I need to calculate the distance using the formula \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). I find \( 3.75^2 \) equals 14.0625 and \( 2.25^2 \) equals 5.0625, giving a sum of 19.125. 

After calculating \( \sqrt{19.125} \), I get approximately 4.372 so I’ll finalize this value. My final answer will just be a straightforward output.

I'm looking to compute the net displacement vector based on a given sequence of movements. I’ll accumulate the x and y components, representing east-west and north-south directions, respectively. 

Starting with x=0 and y=0, I process each movement step-by-step. After all calculations, I end up with net coordinates of x=3.75 and y=-0.75.

I'm trying to calculate the square root more precisely. I started with the value of 14.625, confirming it's equal to 117/8. Breaking it down further, I compute using square roots: 

sqrt(117)/sqrt(8), which simplifies down. After a few calculations, I find an approximate value of 3.825, but it seems slightly too high.

To ensure precision, I’ll check the square root of 23.0625 again, and I realize that 4.8 squared equals 23.04. The difference is minor, and I can use the derivative to adjust my estimate.

I need to compute the displacement vector starting from (0,0). For my movements, I’ll sum the changes in the east (positive) and north (positive) directions. I begin with several sequences of movements. After completing all the movements, my final displacement is (0.25, -4.0). To find the Euclidean distance from the origin, I calculate √(0.25² + (-4.0)²). After some calculations, it looks like the result is approximately 4.007. Let's keep it precise with more decimal points!**Solving the quadratic equation**

I’m using the binomial expansion of (4 + x)² to find a solution. I set it equal to 16.0625, which leads to the quadratic equation 8x + x² = 0.0625. After approximating, I find that x is around 0.0078125. However, when I solve the quadratic more precisely, I calculate x as approximately 0.007809. Thus, the distance is around 4.007809. I’ll round it to eight decimal places for clarity. Final answer: 4.00780902.**Refining the square root calculation**

I need to find the square root of 64.25 more precisely, so I'll use the Taylor expansion method. Firstly, I express it as √(64(1 + 0.25/64)), which leads to a result of approximately 8.0156097408. From this, I calculate x as (-8 + 8.0156097408) / 2, yielding around 0.0078048704. Therefore, the total distance comes out to 4.0078048704. After squaring this to verify, I find it approximates nicely to 16.0625. I'll output 4.00780487."

After tracking my movements, I conclude that the final coordinates are (-2.0, 2.75). Now, I need to calculate the distance from the origin using the Pythagorean theorem. This results in a distance of approximately 3.4, ensuring my calculations add up correctly.**Refining distance calculations**

I'm double-checking my calculations for the square root of 11.5625. I found that 3.4 squared is 11.56, and 3.401 squared equals approximately 11.568801. I realized that 11.5625 equals 185/16, and I can use that to find the square root.

I need to compute the net displacement vector and then find the Euclidean distance from my starting point at (0,0). I’ll remember the conventions: east is positive x and north is positive y. This will help me accurately represent the movement. Once I have the net vector, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance. It’s a straightforward process, but I'll pay close attention to the directions.**Tracing movement sequence**

I’ve mapped out a sequence of movements starting from the origin. First, I head 0.5 south, then 0.25 east, and continue navigating with specific distances in different directions. I can track the coordinates after each movement, keeping track of changes to both x and y accordingly. Each step builds on the last, capturing how my position changes with every action. Looks like I’ve gotten a detailed set of points to plot!**Calculating final displacement and distance**

I’ve continued mapping the movements, ending with coordinates (3.75, 2.25). Now, I need to calculate the distance from the origin using the formula: distance = sqrt(x² + y²). First, I’ll find 3.75² and 2.25², which equals 14.0625 and 5.0625 respectively. Adding these gives 19.125. Then, I’ll calculate the square root of that sum. It seems like I’m trying to be super precise, testing different values to get it just right. Let's finalize the calculation for accuracy!**Calculating square root precisely**

I’m working on calculating the square root of 19.125 more formally and accurately. Starting with the approximation of about 4.373758, I want to refine this using known values and derivatives to calculate it with higher precision. It seems I’m running into some discrepancies with squared results. Through detailed calculations, I’ve determined that a good approximation for sqrt(19.125) is around 4.373219.

After processing all movements, the final displacement is x = 3.75 (east) and y = -0.75 (south).**Calculating Euclidean distance**

I need to compute the Euclidean distance using the formula: sqrt(3.75² + 0.75²). First, I find that 3.75² equals 14.0625, and 0.75² equals 0.5625. Adding these gives me a total of 14.625.

I need to compute the net displacement by finding the difference between the starting and ending points. First, I’ll sum up the distances in the east-west direction and then in the north-south direction. I’ll define east as positive and north also as positive. This way, I can determine the overall displacement and calculate the Euclidean distance from the starting point to the endpoint effectively.**Tracking displacement movements**

I’m mapping out a series of movements step by step. Starting from point zero, I’ll move 0.25 units east, resulting in x = +0.25, then 0.5 units north, giving me y = +0.5. Next, I’ll proceed 1.75 units west, changing x to -1.5, and keep moving north and west with slight adjustments, recalculating x and y each time. By the end of these movements, I’ll track my final position based on these calculations.**Calculating final displacement**

I’ve got the final displacement vector as (-2.0, +2.75). Now, I need to find the distance using the formula sqrt(x² + y²). So, I calculate the components: x = -2.0 leads to 4, and y = 2.75 gives me 7.5625. Adding those up gives me 11.5625, and that should be equal to roughly 3.4 when I compute the square root.

I need to compute the net displacement from start to finish, focusing on the Euclidean distance. To do this, I'll sum the x-direction (where east is positive) and the y-direction (where north is positive). I’m starting from the origin at (0,0) and will process the sequence from there. Then I'll output the final distance. It’s a straightforward calculation, and I’m aiming to keep it clear!**Calculating final coordinates and distance**

I’m processing a series of movements to find my final coordinates. Starting at (0,0), I follow the steps: moving 0.5 south, 0.25 east, and so on. After tracking those changes, I end up at coordinates (3.75, 2.25).  Now, I’ll compute the distance using the formula: distance = sqrt(3.75^2 + 2.25^2). After calculating the squares and summing them, the result comes to around 4.373. I’ll finalize that as my distance!**Calculating precise distance**

I’m trying to be more precise with my distance calculation, focusing on sqrt(19.125) and coming up with an exact value. I get about 4.373064, and when I square that, it reflects a slight discrepancy back to 19.122 — but that's just a minor detail. To be as accurate as possible, I'll output 4.373064. Alright, I’ll keep it simple and just return, ""Final Answer: 4.373064."""

I need to compute the net displacement vector from the starting point (0,0) to the final coordinates (2.0, -2.75).

I see that 3.4 squared equals 11.56, and there's a tiny difference of 0.0025, which helps to confirm that my earlier calculation of the square root is around 3.400367.

distance**

I'm computing the net displacement and Euclidean distance from the starting point (0,0). I’ll take it step by step through each coordinate adjustment, where east is positive x and north is positive y. My final displacement vector is (3.75, -0.75). To find the distance, I'll calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of the components, which gives me approximately 3.823. So, I’ve got everything I need to summarize the results!**Refining the distance calculation**

I’m refining my distance calculation from my previous estimate of 3.823. I’m squaring 3.823 and 3.824 to get closer to 14.625 and applying a linear approximation for better precision. After some adjustments, I arrive at approximately 3.824265. For the final output, I’ll just need to present it clearly, with ""Final Answer:"" followed by the number. So, here it is: Final Answer: 3.824265."
