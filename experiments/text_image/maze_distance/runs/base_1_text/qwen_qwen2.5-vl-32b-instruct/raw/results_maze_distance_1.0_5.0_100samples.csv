### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Initial Position**: Assume the starting point is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

2. **Track the movements**:
   - **Take 0.5 units west**: Move to \((-0.5, 0)\).
   - **Take 0.25 units south**: Move to \((-0.5, -0.25)\).
   - **Take 0.25 units east**: Move to \((-0.25, -"
