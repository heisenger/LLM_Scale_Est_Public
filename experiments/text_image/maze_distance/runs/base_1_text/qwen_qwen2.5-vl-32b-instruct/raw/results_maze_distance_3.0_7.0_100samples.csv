We will keep track of the total displacement in the north-south (N-S) and east-west (E-W) directions.

#### North-South Displacement:
- Take 0.25 units north: +0.25
- Take 0.25 units north: +0.25

Let's break it down step by step:

### Net Displacement in the North-South Direction:
- **North movements**:
  - Take 0.25 units north (4 times): \(0.25 \times 4 = 1.0\) unit north.
  - Take 0.75 units south: \(0.75\) unit south.
  - Take 0.25 units south: \(0.25\) unit south.
  - Take 0.5 units south: \(0.5\) unit south.
