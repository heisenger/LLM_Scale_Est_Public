### Step 1: Analyze the path
We will track the cumulative displacement in the **east-west** (x-axis) and **north-south** (y-axis) directions.

#### East-West Displacement:
- Take 0.75 units east: +0.75
- Take 0.75 units east: +0.75
- Take 0.25 units east: +0.25
- Take 0.75 units east: +0.75

- East: \(0.75 + 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 1.0 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.75 + 0.25 = 7.0\) units
