Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Track Displacements
We'll keep track of the total movement in the north-south direction (N/S) and the east-west direction (E/W).

#### North-South Movements:
- **Take 0.25 units north**: +0.25
- **Take 0.5 units north**: +0.5
- **Take 0.25 units north**: +0.25
