To solve this, we need to analyze the given path step by step and calculate the final position relative to the starting point.

## Step 2
Let's break down the given path into its components and calculate the net displacement in the north and east directions.

## Step 3
The path given is a series of steps in the north, south, east, and west directions. We will sum these steps to find the net displacement.

## Step 4
Calculating the net displacement:
- Initially, the person is at (0,0).
- Take 0.25 units north: (0, 0.25)
- Then Take 0.5 units west: (0.5 west is -0.",

The problem asks to estimate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and the end of a given path within a square boundary.

## Step 2: Break down the path into its north-south and east-west components
To calculate the Euclidean distance, we need to determine the total displacement in the north-south and east-west directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the total northward distance
Total northward distance = 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.75 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0",
