## Step 1: Break down the given path into its vector components to understand the movements.
The path given is a series of steps in the form of ""Take X units direction"", where direction can be north, south, east, or west.


## Step 2: Calculate the total eastward and northward movements separately.
Let's sum the movements:
- Eastward movements: 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.25 =",
