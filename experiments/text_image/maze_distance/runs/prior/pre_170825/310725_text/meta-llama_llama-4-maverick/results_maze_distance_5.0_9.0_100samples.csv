The given movements are in the pattern of alternating between east/north and west/south with increasing units.

## Step 2
Let's sum the east-west movements: $1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8 +9 -10 +11 =6$.
Let's sum the north-south movements: $1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8 +9 -10 +11 =6$.

## Step 3
To estimate the straight-line distance, we use the Euclidean distance formula: $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$, where $x_2 - x_1 = 6$ and $"
