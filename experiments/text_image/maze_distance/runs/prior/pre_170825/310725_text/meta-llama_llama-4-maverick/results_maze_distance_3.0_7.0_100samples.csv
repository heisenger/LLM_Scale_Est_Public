Let's analyze the east-west movement: 1 east, 2 west, 3 east, 4 west, 5 east, 6 west, 7 east, 8 west, 9 east.

## Step 2
Calculating the net eastward movement: 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 + 9 = 5 units east.

## Step 3
Now, analyzing the north-south movement: The given path is incomplete for north-south analysis as it ends with an eastward movement.

## Step 4
Correcting the analysis based on the given path: 1 north, 2 south, 3 north,"
