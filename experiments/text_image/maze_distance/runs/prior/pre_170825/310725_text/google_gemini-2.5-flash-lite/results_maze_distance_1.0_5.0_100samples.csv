1. **Take 1 unit east:** The position becomes (1,0).
2. **Take 1 unit north:** The position becomes (1,1).

The start is at (0,0) and the end is at (1,1).
The Euclidean distance is calculated using the distance formula: $\sqrt{(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2}$
Distance = $\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1+1} = \sqrt{2}$

1. Take 1 units east: The position becomes (0+1, 0) = (1, 0).
2. Take 1 units north: The position becomes (1, 0+1) = (1, 1).

The start point is (0,0) and the end point is (1,1).
The Euclidean distance is calculated as $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$.
Distance = $\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2}$
Distance = $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}$
