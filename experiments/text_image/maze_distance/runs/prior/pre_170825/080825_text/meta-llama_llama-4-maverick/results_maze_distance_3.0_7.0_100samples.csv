To solve this, we first need to understand the movements described and calculate the final position relative to the starting point.

## Step 2
Let's break down the given path:
1. Take 1.0 units east
2. Take 1.0 units north
3. Take 2.0 units west
4. Take 2.0 units south
5. Take 3.0 units east
6. Take 3.0 units north
7. Take 4.0 units west
8. Take 4.0 units south
9. Take 5.0 units east
10. Take 5.0 units north
11. Take 6.0 units west
