The path is described in a series of steps: Take 1.0 units east, then 1.0 units north, then 2.0 units west, then 2.0 units south, then 3.0 units east, then 2.5 units north.

## Step 2: Break down the movements
- 1.0 units east
- 1.0 units north
- 2.0 units west
- 2.0 units south
- 3.0 units east
- 2.5 units north

## Step 3: Calculate the net displacement in the east-west direction
East-west movements: 1.0 east"
