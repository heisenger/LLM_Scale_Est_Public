To solve this, we first need to understand the movements described in the text representation and how they affect the overall position.

## Step 2
The given path is a sequence of movements: east, north, west, south, and so on, with increasing distances.

## Step 3
Let's analyze the movements step by step to determine the final position relative to the starting point.

## Step 4
1. Take 1.0 units east: (1, 0)
2. Take 1.0 units north: (1, 1)
3. Take 2.0 units west: (-1, 1)
4. Take 2.0 units south: (-1, -1"
