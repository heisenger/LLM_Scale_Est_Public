The problem describes a path within a square boundary and asks for the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and the end of the path.

## Step 2: Break down the given path into its vector components.
The path is described as a series of steps: 1.0 units east, 1.0 units north, 2.0 units west, 2.0 units south, 3.0 units east, 2.5 units north.
