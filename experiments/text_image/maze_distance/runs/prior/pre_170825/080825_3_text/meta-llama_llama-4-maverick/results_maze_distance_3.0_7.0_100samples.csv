To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and the end of the given path, we first need to understand the path described in the text representation.

## Step 2
The path is described in a sequence of steps: Take 1.0 units east, then 1.0 units north, then 2.0 units west, then 2.0 units south, and so on, with the direction alternating between east-west and north-south, and the distance increasing by 1 unit after every two steps.

## Step 3
Let's analyze the movements step by step to determine the final position relative to the starting point.
1. Take 1.0 units east: (1, 0)
