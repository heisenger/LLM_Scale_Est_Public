The path is described as a series of movements: Take 1.0 units east, then 1.0 units north, then 2.0 units west, then 2.0 units south, then 3.0 units east, then 2.5 units north.

## Step 2: Break down the movements to calculate the final position relative to the starting point.

The path is described in a sequence of steps: Take 1.0 units east, then Take 1.0 units north, then Take 2.0 units west, then Take 2.0 units south, then Take 3.0 units east, then Take 2.5 units north.

## Step 2: Calculate the net displacement in the east-west direction
First, we move 1.0 unit east, then 2.0 units west, and finally 3.0 units east. The net displacement in the east-west direction is 1.0 - 2.0 + 3.0 = 2.0 units east.

## Step 1: Understand the path description
The path is described in a series of steps: Take 1.0 units east, then 1.0 units north, then 2.0 units west, then 2.0 units south, then 3.0 units east, then 2.5 units north.

## Step 2: Calculate the net displacement in the east-west direction

The path is described in a series of steps: Take 1.0 units east, then 1.0 units north, then 2.0 units west, then 2.0 units south, then 3.0 units east, then 2.5 units north.

## Step 2: Calculate the total east-west movement
First, move 1.0 unit east, then 2.0 units west, then 3.0 units east. The net eastward movement is 1.0 - 2.0 + 3.0 = 2.0 units.
