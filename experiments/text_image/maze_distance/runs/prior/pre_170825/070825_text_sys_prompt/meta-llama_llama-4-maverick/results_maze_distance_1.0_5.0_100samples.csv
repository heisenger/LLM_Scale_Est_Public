The path is described in a series of steps: Take 1.0 units east, then 1.0 units north, then 2.0 units west, then 2.0 units south, then 3.0 units east, then 2.5 units north.

## Step 2: Calculate the total east-west movement
First, calculate the net eastward movement: 1.0 units east - 2.0 units west + 3.0 units east = 2.0 units east.

## Step 3: Calculate the total north-south movement
Then, calculate the net northward movement: 1.0 units north - 2.0 units"

The problem describes a path within a square boundary given in a text-based representation. The path involves a series of movements in the cardinal directions (east, north, west, south) with specified distances.

## Step 2: Break down the given path into its components
1. Take 1.0 units east
2. Take 1.0 units north
3. Take 2.0 units west
4. Take 2.0 units south
5. Take 3.0 units east
6. Take 2.5 units north

## Step 3: Calculate the net displacement in the east-west direction
- Initially, move 1.0"

The path is described in a series of steps: Take 1.0 units east, then 1.0 units north, then 2.0 units west, then 2.0 units south, then 3.0 units east, then 2.5 units north.

## Step 2: Calculate the total east-west movement
First, calculate the net eastward movement: 1.0 units east - 2.0 units west + 3.0 units east = 2.0 units east.

## Step 3: Calculate the total north-south movement
Then, calculate the net northward movement: 1.0 units north - 2.0 units"
