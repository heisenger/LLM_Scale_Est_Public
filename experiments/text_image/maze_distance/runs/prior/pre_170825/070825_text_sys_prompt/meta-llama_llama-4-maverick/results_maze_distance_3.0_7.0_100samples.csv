The path is given as a series of steps in the form of directions (east, north, west, south) with associated distances.

## Step 2: Translate the given path into coordinate changes.
Let's break down the path:
- Take 1.0 units east: (1, 0)
- Then Take 1.0 units north: (1, 1)
- Then Take 2.0 units west: (-1, 1)
- Then Take 2.0 units south: (-1, -1)

To solve this, we first need to understand the given path and calculate the final position relative to the starting point.

## Step 2
The given path is a series of movements in the east, north, west, and south directions. We need to break down the movements:
- Take 1.0 units east
- Take 1.0 units north
- Take 2.0 units west
- Take 2.0 units south
- Take 3.0 units east
- Take 3.0 units north
- Take 4.0 units west
- Take 4.0 units south
- Take 5.0 units east
- Take 5.0 units north"

To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and the end of the given path, we need to understand the movements described in the path.

## Step 2
The given path is described as a series of movements in the cardinal directions (east, north, west, south) with specific distances.

## Step 3
Let's analyze the movements step by step:
1. Take 1.0 units east
2. Take 1.0 units north
3. Take 2.0 units west
4. Take 2.0 units south
5. Take 3.0 units east
6. Take 3.0 units north
7. Take 4.0 units west
