To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and the end of the given path, we first need to understand the path described in the text representation.

## Step 2
The path is described as a series of steps in the east, north, west, and south directions with varying distances.

## Step 3
Let's analyze the given path step by step:
- Take 1.0 units east, then Take 1.0 units north
- Take 2.0 units west, then Take 2.0 units south
- Take 3.0 units east, then Take 3.0 units north

To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and the end of the given path, we first need to understand the movements described in the path.

## Step 2
The path involves a series of east-west and north-south movements. We need to sum up these movements to determine the final position relative to the starting point.

## Step 3
Let's analyze the east-west movements: Take 1.0 units east, then Take 2.0 units west, then Take 3.0 units east, then Take 4.0 units west, then Take 5.0 units east, then Take 6.0 units west, then Take 7.0 units east, then Take 8.0"

To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and the end of the given path, we first need to understand the movements described in the path.

## Step 2
The path involves a series of movements in the east-west and north-south directions. We need to sum up these movements to find the final position relative to the starting point.

## Step 3
