The given path is described in a series of steps involving movements in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

## Step 2: Translate the path description into coordinate changes
To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and end of the path, we need to calculate the final position relative to the starting position. We will treat the starting position as the origin (0,0) of a coordinate system, with east as the positive x-direction and north as the positive y-direction.

## Step 3: Calculate the total change in x and y coordinates
Let's add up the movements:
- West is negative x-direction, so: $-0.5 - 0.75"

The path is described as a series of steps in the cardinal directions (east, north, south, west) with specified distances.

## Step 3: Calculate the total displacement in the east and north directions
To find the Euclidean distance between the start and end points, we need to calculate the total displacement in the east and north directions.

The problem requires calculating the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and end points of a given path described in text.

## Step 2: Break down the path into its components
To calculate the Euclidean distance, we need to determine the final position relative to the starting point. The path is described as a series of movements in the east, south, and west directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the total eastward and southward movement
To find the final position, we sum all the eastward movements and subtract any westward movements to get the total eastward displacement. Similarly, we sum all the southward movements to get the total southward displacement.

The given path is described in a series of steps involving movements in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) within a square boundary.

## Step 2: Translate the path description into coordinate changes
To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and end of the path, we need to calculate the final position relative to the starting point. We'll treat the starting point as (0,0) on a coordinate system where east is +x and north is +y.

## Step 3: Calculate the total movement in the x and y directions
Let's sum the movements:

The task is to calculate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and end points of a given path described in a text-based format.

## Step 2: Break down the given path into individual movements
The path is described as a series of movements in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). We need to translate these movements into changes in the x and y coordinates.

## Step 3: Assign numerical values to the directions
Let's assign east as +x, west as -x, north as +y, and south as -y.

## Step 4: Calculate the total change in x and y coordinates based on the given path
