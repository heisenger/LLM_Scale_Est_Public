#### Define the path movements:
1. **North**: Increase in the y-coordinate.
2. **South**: Decrease in the y-coordinate.
3. **East**: Increase in the x-coordinate.
4. **West**: Decrease in the x-coordinate.

#### Initialize the starting point:
- **Start at (0, 0)**.

#### Track the movements:
1. **Take 0.25 units north**:  
   - New position: (0, 0.25).
2. **Take 0.5 units east**:  
   - New position: (0.5, 0.25).
