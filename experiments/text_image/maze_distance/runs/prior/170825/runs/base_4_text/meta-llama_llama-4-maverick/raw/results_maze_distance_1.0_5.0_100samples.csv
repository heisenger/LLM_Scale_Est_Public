The problem asks to calculate the straight-line distance between the start and end of a given path within a square boundary. The path is described in a series of steps in the cardinal directions.

## Step 2: Break down the path into its vector components
To find the straight-line distance, we need to sum up the movements in the east-west and north-south directions separately.

## Step 3: Sum the east-west movements
East movements are positive, and west movements are negative.

The problem asks to estimate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and end of a given path described in text.

## Step 2: Break down the path into its components
The path is described as a series of steps in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

## Step 3: Calculate the total displacement in the north-south direction
To do this, we sum the northward movements and subtract the southward movements.
Northward movements: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 1.0 + 0."
