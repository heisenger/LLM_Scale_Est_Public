To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given text description of the path and calculate the final position relative to the starting point.

## Step 2
Let's break down the movements:
- North and south movements will be considered as changes in the y-coordinate.
- East and west movements will be considered as changes in the x-coordinate.

## Step 3
We'll sum the movements in each direction.
- North: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 1.5 (no, it's 0.25) + 0.75 (no, it's 0.25) = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0."
