To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and end of the path, we first need to understand the movements described in the text.

## Step 2
Let's break down the movements:
1. Take 0.5 units west
2. Take 0.25 units south
3. Take 0.25 units east
4. Take 0.25 units south
5. Take 0.25 units west
6. Take 0.25 units south
7. Take 0.5 units west
8. Take 0.25 units north
9. Take 0.75 units west
10. Take 0.25 units south
11. Take 0.25"

To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and the end of the path, we first need to understand the movements described in the given text.

## Step 2
Let's break down the movements step by step:
1. Take 0.5 units west
2. Take 0.25 units south
3. Take 0.25 units east
4. Take 0.25 units south
5. Take 0.25 units west
6. Take 0.25 units south
7. Take 0.5 units west
8. Take 0.25 units north
9. Take 0.75 units west
10. Take 0.25 units south
