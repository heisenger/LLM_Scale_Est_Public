The given path is described in a series of steps involving movements in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) with specified distances.

## Step 2: Break down the path into its components
To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and end of the path, we need to calculate the net displacement in the north-south and east-west directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the net northward displacement
Northward movements: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.25 units.
Southward movements: 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.5 +"

The problem asks us to estimate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and end of a given path within a square boundary based on a text description.

## Step 2: Break down the given path into its north-south and east-west components to simplify the calculations.
To simplify, we'll track the north-south and east-west movements separately.

## Step 3: Calculate the total north-south movement.
North movements: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.25 units north.
South movements: 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.5 + "

The problem provides a text-based description of a path within a square boundary and asks to estimate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and the end of the path.

## Step 2: Break down the path into its components
To calculate the Euclidean distance, we first need to understand the net displacement in the north-south and east-west directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the net displacement in the north-south direction
Let's sum the north and south movements:
- North movements: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.25 = 2.0 units
- South"

The task is to calculate the Euclidean distance between the start and end points of a given path described in text.

## Step 2: Break down the path into movements
The path is described as a series of movements in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

## Step 3: Calculate the total movement in the north-south direction
To do this, we need to sum up all the north movements and subtract all the south movements.
North movements: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.75 = 1.75 units
South movements: 0.75 + 0.25 + 0."
