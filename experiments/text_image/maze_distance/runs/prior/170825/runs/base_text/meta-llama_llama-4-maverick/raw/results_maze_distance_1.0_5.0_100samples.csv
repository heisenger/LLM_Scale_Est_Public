The problem asks to estimate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and end of a given path within a square boundary. The path is described in a series of steps involving movements in the cardinal directions.

## Step 2: Break down the path into its vector components
To calculate the Euclidean distance, we need to determine the net displacement in the x (east-west) and y (north-south) directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the net displacement in the x-direction
The path involves several movements: 0.5 units west, 0.25 units east, 0.25 units west, 0.5 units west, 0.75"
