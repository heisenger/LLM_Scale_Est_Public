The path is described in a series of steps involving movements in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

## Step 2: Break down the path into its components
To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and the end of the path, we need to calculate the total displacement in the north-south and east-west directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the total northward and southward movement
Northward movements: $0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 1.5 + 0.25 = 1.75$ units (initially), but we need to account for all movements. So,"

North-south movement:

Let's compute the total displacement in the north-south and east-west directions.

North-south: 
Total north = 0.25 units
Total south = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 3.5 units
