To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and end of the path, we first need to understand the movements described in the text.

## Step 2
Breaking down the movements:
- West: 1.0 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 1.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.5 = 6.5 units
- East: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75 units
Net West movement = 6.5 - "

To solve this, we need to calculate the total displacement in the x (east-west) and y (north-south) directions.

## Step 2
Let's break down the given path:
- West is considered negative x-direction, and east is positive x-direction.
- North is considered positive y-direction, and south is negative y-direction.

## Step 3
Calculate the total displacement in the x-direction:
- Total west = 1.0 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 1.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.5"

To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and end of the path, we first need to understand the movements described in the text.

## Step 2
Let's break down the movements into their north-south and east-west components to simplify the calculations.

## Step 3
For the north-south movement:
- North movements: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 2.0 units
- South movements: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.0 unit
