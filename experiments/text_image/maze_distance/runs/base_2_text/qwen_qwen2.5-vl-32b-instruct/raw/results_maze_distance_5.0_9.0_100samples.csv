### Step 1: Track the net displacement in the x and y directions
We will track the cumulative movement in the x and y directions based on the given path description.

#### Initial position:
- \( x = 0 \)
- \( y = 0 \)

#### Path description:
1. **Take 1.0 units west**:
   - \( x = 0 - 1.0 = -1.0 \)
   - \( y = 0 \)
