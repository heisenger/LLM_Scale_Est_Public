### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initial Position**: Start at (0, 0).

2. **Track movements**:
   - **0.25 units north**: Move to (0, 0.25).
   - **0.25 units west**: Move to (-0.25, 0.25).
   - **0.25 units north**: Move to (-0.25, 0.5).

### Step 1: Break down the movements
We'll track the net displacement in the north-south direction (ΔN) and the east-west direction (ΔE).

#### North-South Movement:
- **0.25 units north** → +0.25
- **0.25 units north** → +0.25
- **0.25 units north** → +0.25
- **0.25 units north** → +0.25
