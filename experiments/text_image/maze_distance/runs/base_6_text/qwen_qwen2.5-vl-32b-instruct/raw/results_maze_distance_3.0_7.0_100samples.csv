The path described involves a series of movements in cardinal directions. To estimate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and end of the path, we will:

1. **Track the net displacement in the north-south direction (vertical) and east-west direction (horizontal).**
2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the Euclidean distance.**

#### Step 1: Analyze the path
We will break down the movements into their respective components:

- **Vertical (north/south) movements:**
  - Take 0.25 units north.
  - Take 0.25 units north.
  - Take 0.25 units north.
