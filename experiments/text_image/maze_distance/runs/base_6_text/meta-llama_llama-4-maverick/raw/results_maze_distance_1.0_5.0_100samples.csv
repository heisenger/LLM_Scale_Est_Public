North-South:

Total south = 4 units, Total north = 0 units
Net south = 4 units

East-West: 
0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 units east
0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 units west
Net east = 0 units

The straight-line distance can be estimated using the Pythagorean theorem:

West is considered negative x-direction, and east is positive x-direction. North is considered positive y-direction, and south is negative y-direction.

- Total south = 1.25 + 0.5 + 0.75 + 0.5 + 0.75 + 0.25 = 4 units
- Total east = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 units
- Total west = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 units

Since total east = total west, the net east-west movement is 0 units.
The net southward movement is 4 units.

The straight-line distance is simply the net southward movement since there's no net east-west movement.
