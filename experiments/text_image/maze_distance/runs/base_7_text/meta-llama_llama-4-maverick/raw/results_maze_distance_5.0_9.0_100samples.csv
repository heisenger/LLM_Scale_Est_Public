The problem asks to estimate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and the end of a given path within a square boundary.

## Step 2: Break down the path into its components to calculate the total displacement in the x and y directions.
To find the Euclidean distance, we need to calculate the total displacement in the x (east-west) and y (north-south) directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the total displacement in the x-direction.
The path involves multiple steps in the west and east directions. We will sum these steps to find the net displacement in the x-direction. West is considered negative, and east is considered positive.
