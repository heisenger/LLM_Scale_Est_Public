First, we sum the movements in the west direction: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 2.5 units.

## Step 2: Calculate the total movement in the east direction
Then, we sum the movements in the east direction: 0.25 units.

The net movement in the west direction is the total west movement minus the total east movement: 2.5 - 0.25 = 2.25 units.

To estimate the straight-line distance between the start and the end of the path, we first need to understand the movements described in the path.

## Step 2
Let's break down the movements:
1. Take 0.5 units west
2. Take 0.25 units south
3. Take 0.25 units east
4. Take 0.25 units south
5. Take 0.25 units west
6. Take 0.25 units south
7. Take 0.5 units west
8. Take 0.25 units north
9. Take 0.75 units west
