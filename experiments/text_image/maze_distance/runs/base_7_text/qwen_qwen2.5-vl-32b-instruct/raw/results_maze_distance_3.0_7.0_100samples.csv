We will track the net displacement in the north-south and east-west directions step by step based on the given path description.

#### Initial Position:
Start at the origin: \( (0, 0) \).

#### Step-by-Step Displacement:

1. **Take 0.25 units north**:
   - New position: \( (0, 0.25) \).

2. **Take 0.25 units west**:
   - New position: \( (-0.25, 0.25) \).

3. **Take 0.25 units north**:
   - New position: \( (-0.25, 0.5",

### Step 1: Track the movements
We'll keep track of the net displacement in the north-south and east-west directions.

#### Vertical (North-South) Movements:
- Take 0.25 units north: +0.25
- Take 0.25 units north: +0.25

#### Initial Position:
- Start at \((0, 0)\).

#### Track Movements:

1. **Take 0.25 units north**:
   - Position: \((0, 0.25)\).

2. **Take 0.25 units west**:
   - Position: \((-0.25, 0.25)\).

3. **Take 0.25 units north**:
