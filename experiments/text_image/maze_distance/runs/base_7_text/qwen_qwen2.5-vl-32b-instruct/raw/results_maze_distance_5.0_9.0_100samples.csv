### Step 1: Break down the path into its components
We will track the net displacement in the **west-east** direction (horizontal) and the **north-south** direction (vertical).

#### Horizontal (West-East) Displacement:
- **West**: Each ""west"" movement contributes negatively to the displacement.
- **East**: Each ""east"" movement contributes positively to the displacement.

#### Vertical (North-South) Displacement:
- **North**: Each ""north"" movement contributes positively to",

### Step 1: Initialize coordinates
- Start at the origin: \( (x, y) = (0, 0) \).

### Step 2: Process each movement
We will update the coordinates step by step based on the given instructions.
