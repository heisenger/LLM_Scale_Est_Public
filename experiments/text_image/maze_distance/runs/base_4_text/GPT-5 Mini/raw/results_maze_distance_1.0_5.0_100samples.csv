I'm calculating the net displacement vector from the origin by interpreting directions: west as -x, east as +x, north as +y, and south as -y.

I'm starting the process of computing the net displacement vector from the origin point (0,0). For this, I'll define north as the positive y-axis and east as the positive x-axis. By setting up this coordinate system, I can work out the direction and magnitude of displacements based on those definitions. It's a clear path to determine where I end up after any given series of movements! Let's make sure the calculations reflect that properly.**Summing displacement increments**

I’ll process the sequence of movements to compute the net displacement. Starting from (0,0), I need to track the changes in x and y based on the directions. The movements involve various increments in different directions, and I'll sum them for x. 

The sequence is straightforward, and I'm particularly focusing on the increments moving east and west. It’s time to calculate the total change in the x-value! Let's get that final number together!**Calculating net displacement**

I’m going to add up all the increments for x and y. For x, after summing the values, my final result is 3.75 units east. Then, for y, starting from zero, I’ve calculated a total of 2.25 units north. Next, I’m going to find the overall distance using the Pythagorean theorem. 

I’ll compute the squares of both x and y, then sum them, followed by taking the square root. Seems like it’s a straightforward way to find that distance!**Refining my calculation**

I’m in the process of refining the square root calculation for 19.125. I’ve computed 4.373 squared to see that it’s slightly low, then tried 4.374, but that went a bit high. So, I’m aiming for precision between these two values. I keep adjusting and estimating, and it seems 4.3732 gets really close to my target number.

I'm thinking about how to compute the net displacement from the starting point. I'll track my movements in the x-direction (where east is positive) and the y-direction (where north is positive). Starting at coordinates (0, 0), I want to get a clear picture of how far I’ve moved in each direction. This will help me understand the overall displacement from the original point. Alright, let's see how this works!**Tracking movement steps**

I need to list all the steps taken to compute net displacement. 

Starting at (0,0), I’ll track my changes in x and y based on movements: 

1. Moving 0.5 south adds to my y. 
2. Then, I’ll make a series of moves east and north, updating x and y each time. I should carefully note the calculations for each step. 

Overall, these will help me keep clarity on my final position after all movements!**Calculating final distance**

I’ve reached the final position of (3.75, 2.25). Now, I need to calculate the distance using the formula: distance = sqrt(x² + y²). 

First, I’ll compute the squares: 3.75² equals approximately 14.0625, and 2.25² equals about 5.0625. Their sum gives 19.125. 

Now, I'll find the square root of that, which is around 4.3731 when rounded to five decimal places. 

Let's present the final answer clearly! Final Answer: 4.3731."
