I'm computing the net displacement vector, starting from the origin. I'll use the directional conventions where west is negative x, east is positive x, north is positive y, and south is negative y. So, I need to sum the x and y components. To kick things off, I'll set x and y to 0 and then parse the movements sequentially from there. This should give me a clear picture of the overall displacement!**Determining final coordinates**

I’ve recorded a series of movements that update the x and y coordinates step by step. After computing all directions, I find the final coordinates are (-6.0, 2.25). Now I need to calculate the distance from the origin. This involves using the Pythagorean theorem: distance equals the square root of the sum of the squares of the x and y coordinates. That results in approximately 6.409, which I verified through squaring to ensure it’s accurate. So, it looks like the distance is about 6.41!**Refining the distance calculation**

I’m trying to compute the square root of 41.0625 to get a precise distance. It seems to be around 6.409, but I want to verify that. When I square 6.409, I get something slightly over 41.065, which feels too high. Then, I check 6.408 and find it’s much closer to 41.062464, which is very near what I need. So, I’ll say the square root is about 6.4080. Final answer: 6.408."

Then I switch to the y-axis, starting at 0, and calculate the changes, concluding with a final value of 3.75. Now, I'll find the distance using the formula \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). I compute the squares and add them up, estimating the square root, which seems to be between 7.289 and 7.295.**Refining square root calculations**

I’m working on finding a more precise estimate for the square root of 53.125. After trying various approximations, I'm settling around 7.2887. I check values like 7.290 and 7.289, refining the estimates with adjustments. I also break down 53.125 into fractions to help with calculations, using properties of square roots. Ultimately, I’m aiming to provide a final value that balances accuracy with clarity in the explanation. So, I'll round it to 7.2887 for the final answer."

I need to focus on computing the net displacement vector from the start point to the end point.

Typically, I'll consider positive values for east and north, with north represented as positive y. I'll start my calculations from the coordinates (0,0). Let's ensure all calculations are clear and accurate.**Summing up the moves**

I’ve listed the moves and their impacts on my position. The first move takes me 0.5 units west, adjusting x to -0.5. Then I go 0.25 units north, raising y to 0.25. Each subsequent move continues adjusting x and y according to the specified directions: mostly west and south. Following all the calculations, my final position ends up being (-5.0, -1.5). Now, I can summarize this net displacement accurately!**Calculating distance from origin**

I’m calculating the distance from the origin to the final position. The formula I’m using is the square root of the sum of the squares of the coordinates: sqrt(5^2 + 1.5^2).

I'm calculating the coordinates based on movement in different directions. It starts at (0,0) and adds up movements: first, I move 0.75 units east to (0.75,0), then 0.25 north to (0.75,0.25). I continue this pattern, adjusting the x and y values according to each movement step, ensuring I track my position correctly.

I'm continuing to calculate the final coordinates based on the movements: I end up at (7.5, 2.25). Now, I need to compute the distance using the formula sqrt(7.5^2 + 2.25^2). I find that 7.5 squared is 56.25, and 2.25 squared is 5.0625, giving me a sum of 61.3125. 

Now, I’m figuring out the square root, which turns out to be around 7.83. It seems close enough, but I consider if I should use slightly more precise values, maybe even rounding to 7.833? That would be a reasonable choice!**Calculating the final answer**

I'm finding the derivative with 2 times 7.83, which gives me 15.66. From there, I determine the increment by dividing about 0.0036 by 15.66, resulting in approximately 0.0002298. This means my root is around 7.83023. Since the target is larger, I adjust slightly upward to get about 7.830. Earlier, I thought it might be 7.835, but the final answer feels right around 7.830.

I need to compute the final displacement between the starting point and the endpoint, which means I have to find the Euclidean distance. The directions are clear: going west means negative x, east means positive x, north is positive y, and south is negative y. I'll sum the x and y coordinates to get the final result. Starting from (0,0), I'll work through this step by step to ensure accuracy.**Summarizing movements**

I'm tracking movements step by step to arrive at the final coordinates. Starting from an initial point, I note the following: moving 1.0 west puts the x at -1.0; then 0.25 north raises y to 0.25. After several further movements—mostly west with some north and a few east—I arrive at the final coordinates of (-6.0, 2.25). It feels good to have methodically gone through each step to ensure accuracy!**Calculating distance precisely**

I'm figuring out the distance using the formula, which includes some squaring and square-rooting. I start with the coordinates (-6.0, 2.25) and calculate the distance step by step, beginning with sqrt(6^2 + 2.25^2). After some back-and-forth with squares to get close to the right number, I realize I'll need to compute sqrt(657) for more precision. At one point, I estimate around 6.4068 as an approximation, but I see earlier I had 6.409. Let me double-check to make sure everything adds up!**Finalizing distance calculation**

I’m calculating the distance and starting with 6.4 squared, which gives me 40.96. Then I factor in adjustments and calculate increments needed to get closer to my target of 41.0625. After some back-and-forth with my calculations, I land on an estimate of around 6.408 for the square root. It seems very close! So, I think I'll finalize my answer at 6.408 and just present it.

I need to compute the net displacement from start to end. For the x-axis, I'll subtract the westward movement from the eastward movement, and for the y-axis, I'll simply sum the southward movement as positive. So, I'll initialize x = 0 and y = 0 before I start tallying everything up. It's important to keep things neat to get the right final values!**Summing movements**

I need to keep track of movements step by step. I’m starting with an initial position, then adding movements east and south sequentially. For example, first I move 0.25 east, making x = 0.25, then I move 0.5 south, bringing y to 0.5. I’ll continue this pattern until I've accounted for all the movements listed, updating my x and y values after each step. At the end, I'll have the total displacement calculated from the sum of these movements!**Calculating final distance**

I’m continuing to update my position with movement entries. After a series of movements, I reach final coordinates of x=6.5 and y=5.75. To find the distance, I’ll calculate the square root of the sum of squares, starting with 6.5 squared and 5.75 squared.

I need to compute the net displacement vector by summing the components. For the east direction, I'll sum values accordingly. I have a sequence to follow, listing all movements step by step. I’ll identify which steps are east, and then calculate the total. I have to be cautious and ensure I consider both positive and negative values for movement in different directions. Let’s compute the sums and finalize the answer. 

Final Answer: 7.0**Summing movements**

I’m gathering the movements to calculate net displacement. For the east positions of 0.25, I add up specific steps: there are five instances totaling 1.25. The 0.5 steps add up to 2.0 from four positions, while the two 1.0 steps contribute another 2.0. Plus, there’s 1.5 from the two 0.75 steps. When I sum all these, I get a net east of 7.75 after accounting for west movements. 

Next, for the north movements, I find a total of 3.0 and subtract 1.25 from the south movements, resulting in a net north of 1.75. So my final displacement vector is (7.75, 1.75).**Calculating Euclidean distance**

I'm calculating the Euclidean distance, which involves using the formula sqrt(7.75^2 + 1.75^2). I find 7.75^2 equals 60.0625 and 1.75^2 equals 3.0625, adding up to 63.125. The square root of that is approximately 7.945. After refining my calculations further, I determine that the more accurate value is around 7.94512. Since the user expects a clean output, I'll present the final answer as three decimal places:

I'm thinking we need to calculate the net displacement vector from a given path and then find the Euclidean distance. To do this, I should compute the cumulative values for east (x) and north (y) directions. Starting from the origin at (0,0), I’ll designate east as positive x, north as positive y, with south being negative y and west negative x. This will guide my calculations effectively.**Tracking movement coordinates**

I'm listing the movements step-by-step to track the coordinates. Starting from the origin, the movements have been calculated as follows: Moving 1.5 units east results in x=1.5, then moving 0.25 units south gives y=-0.25. I keep adjusting the x and y values based on each move. I continue documenting each movement, ensuring that I account for east, west, north, and south adjustments. The final coordinates should help determine the net displacement.**Calculating final distance**

It seems I’m finalizing the movements, ending at the coordinates (6.25, 3.75). To find the distance, I'll compute it using the formula: distance = sqrt(6.25^2 + 3.75^2). First, I find the squares: 6.25^2 equals 39.0625 and 3.75^2 equals 14.0625, summing to 53.125. The square root of that gives me around 7.289.

I need to find the net displacement vector from the moves, which means summing the distances traveled west-east and north-south. For west, I think of it as positive x. I’ll compute the total west distance by adding up all the west moves and subtracting the east moves. I should list the moves with their directions and magnitudes clearly to be accurate in my calculations. Let's ensure I don’t miss any of the distances.**Summing movement values**

I want to sum the west moves carefully. I’ll list their values: 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 1.25, 0.75, 0.5, 1.0, and 0.25—which totals 13 items. 

By pairwise summation, I find the total west distance is 7.0 units. For the east movement of 0.5, the net x is 6.5 units to the west. Moving on to the south adds another layer, with a total of 5.75 south moves giving 5.5 units after accounting for north. Thus, my displacement vector is (-6.5, -5.5).**Calculating distance magnitude**

I need to compute the squares of the displacement values: 6.5 squared gives me 42.25, and 5.5 squared is 30.25. Summing those up, I get 72.5. Now, to find the square root of that: I estimate it’s a bit more than 8.5. Specifically, when I calculate, I get approximately 8.5147. 

I’ll format the final output correctly, so it reads ""Final Answer: 8.5147."" However, maybe rounding that gives 8.515 — I’ll stick with 8.5147 for this context."

I need to compute the displacement vector from the starting point to the endpoint while tracking the x direction as east being positive and the y direction as north being positive.

I’m keeping a detailed record of these changes to see the overall displacement and end up with the final coordinates. Let's keep adding up the movements!**Finalizing coordinates and distance**

I'm finalizing the coordinates after several movements: (5.0, -5.5). To calculate the distance from the origin, I’ll use the distance formula. It looks like I’m using the square root of the sum of the squares of the x and y coordinates. I’m working through the math and realizing that sqrt(55.25) is about 7.433.

I need to find the straight-line distance between the start and end points, which is typically done by summing the vector components. I'll consider east as positive and north as positive.

I'll carefully calculate the changes in these components to determine the final position and then use that to derive the distance. Let's work through this together!**Tracking movements and coordinates**

I’m mapping out the movements step-by-step to determine the final coordinates. Starting at (0,0), I’m plotting each movement east or north, adjusting the x and y positions accordingly. For instance, after the first few steps, I’ll reach (0.75, 0) and continue tracking all changes to see where I end up. I need to ensure that every movement is accounted for accurately, recognizing the direction and the distances moved! Let’s keep going to find that final position!**Finding the final coordinates and distance**

I’ve reached my final coordinates at (7.5, 2.25). To find the distance, I’ll use the formula: distance equals the square root of the sum of the squares of each coordinate. So, I get sqrt(7.5^2 + 2.25^2), which calculates to about 7.835. I need to compute this more precisely, considering smaller adjustments to get a better approximation. After refining my calculation, I conclude the distance is approximately 7.83023. Let's round it to a helpful number of decimal places for clarity!"

I’m laying out the moves step by step. First, I start by moving east, adding 0.25 to x's total. Then, I move north and adjust y in the same way. I keep tallying these increments until I reach the total displacements for both x and y. I end with a series of movements that will help me compute the final coordinates accurately, accounting for all directions, including some south and west movements too!**Computing final coordinates**

I’m wrapping up my calculations for the final coordinates, which are (7.75, 1.75). To find the distance, I’ll use the formula \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). I first calculate \( 7.75^2 \) and \( 1.75^2 \), which give me 60.0625 and 3.0625, respectively. Adding those together results in 63.125. Then, using interpolation between square roots, I find that the approximate distance is 7.945. I'll keep the answer precise and output it with five decimals."

I need to compute the net displacement vector, starting at (0,0). I’ll consider movements in the east direction as +x and north as +y. I plan to process the moves sequentially, so I’ll keep a running total for both x and y. To begin, I’ll initialize x and y at 0. This will help me keep everything organized as I calculate the cumulative displacement based on the given movements.**Summing movement displacements**

I'm processing a series of movements step-by-step. First, I move +1.5 east, putting x at 1.5. Then I go 0.25 south, which brings y to -0.25. I continue: moving 0.25 east makes x 1.75, then 0.25 north returns y to 0. Following this pattern, I keep adjusting both coordinates through each move. I’ll track these changes until I finish, ultimately getting the final net displacement vector based on all these steps.**Calculating Euclidean distance**

I'm determining the final position after a series of movements, which is (6.25, 3.75). To find the Euclidean distance from the origin, I use the formula sqrt(6.25^2 + 3.75^2). First, I calculate 6.25^2 and 3.75^2, then sum them to get 53.125.

I need to compute the displacement between the start and end points and provide a precise answer, rounding to four decimals. I should consider the x-axis as positive for east and negative for west, while the y-axis is positive for north. The starting point is (0,0), which is quite clear. I just have to ensure I’m precise with the calculations to get the right outcome for the user! 

Final Answer: <number>**Processing movement sequence**

I’m going through a series of movements to determine the final position based on the given directions. I start with (0,0) and make various moves to the west and north, adjusting my x and y coordinates after each step. There are multiple changes, including movements back to the south and east as well, which means I have to keep track carefully to avoid any errors. Ultimately, the end point is calculated as (-6, 2.25).**Calculating distance from origin**

Now, I need to find the distance from the origin to the final coordinates, which are (−6, 2.25). I'll calculate it using the formula: square root of the sum of the squares of the coordinates. That's sqrt(6^2 + 2.25^2). 

After the initial computation, I realize I need to ensure precision. I'm testing approximate values, like 6.40625 and 6.407, to find the closest square root to 41.0625. I will check sqrt(41.0625) and refine until I accurately estimate around 6.4077, verifying my work along the way!**Calculating square root**

I’m working on calculating the precise square root of 657, starting with my approximation of 25.632. Squaring that gives me a value of around 656.999424, which is slightly less than 657. To improve my approximation, I’m adjusting the value using linearization, which gives an updated estimate around 25.63201124. Finally, I divide that by 4 to get approximately 6.4080. I want to confirm this value is correct, so I’ll present it as the final answer.

I need to compute the net displacement vector from the starting point. To do that, I’ll sum the eastward movement as positive x and the westward movement as negative x.

So, I’ll initialize my values with x=0 and y=0, and then proceed to calculate the net displacement based on these values.**Processing movement sequence**

I’m laying out a sequence of movements to compute the net displacement in x and y coordinates. Starting at (0,0), I’ll note each step carefully. For instance, moving 0.25 east increases x by 0.25, while moving north adds to y. I’ll repeat this process through several movements in different directions, adjusting my x and y values accordingly at each step. With actions including east, north, and a couple of south and west adjustments, I’ll calculate the final position.**Calculating final coordinates and distance**

I’ve completed my movements, ending at coordinates (7.75, 1.75). Now, I need to compute the distance from the starting point using the formula of the square root of the sum of squares.

I need to compute the net displacement vector from a sequence of moves. I’ll sum the east and west moves as x (where east is positive), and the north and south moves as y (where north is positive). I should start at the origin point (0,0) and initialize x and y to zero. This way, I can track my movement in both dimensions. Let’s get started on the calculation!**Processing movements**

I need to process each movement step to determine the net displacement. Starting from (0, 0), I’ll record changes in x for east and west movements, and changes in y for north and south movements. 

For example, after moving east 0.25, my x becomes 0.25. Then, by moving south 0.25, my y updates to -0.25. I’ll continue this for each step, closely tracking my position after every move to see how they affect my coordinates. Let's go through the list step by step!**Calculating final distance**

Now I’ve processed my movements, and my final coordinates are x=1.5 and y=-5.5. To find the distance from the origin, I’ll use the formula for distance: sqrt(x^2 + y^2), which gives me sqrt(1.5^2 + (-5.5)^2). 

That simplifies to sqrt(2.25 + 30.25) = sqrt(32.5). Now, I’ll calculate that value, and the approximate distance is around 5.700877. I’ll finalize the output as ""Final Answer: 5.700877."""

I need to compute the vector sum of the movements to get the total displacement from the start to the end. The basic idea is to use the defined directions: west is the negative x direction, east is positive x, north is positive y, and south is negative y. So, I should sum up the x and y components. I'll start by initializing both x and y to zero to keep track of my calculations.**Updating coordinates and positions**

I'm calculating the displacement by updating the x and y coordinates based on movements in different directions. For instance, if I move 0.25 west, I subtract from x, which updates its value to -0.25. As I continue to apply the same logic for the movements recorded, I make adjustments to both coordinates accordingly. I’ll keep track of these changes in sequence to arrive at the final displacement from the starting point to the end position.**Calculating final displacement and distance**

I've updated the x and y coordinates based on a series of movements. After computing these sums, I find the final displacement vector as (-6.5, -5.5). Now, to determine the distance, I’ll apply the formula, which involves calculating the square root of the sum of the squares of both coordinates. After doing the math, I find it to be approximately 8.514693, rounding it to six decimal places. My final output will be presented as ""Final Answer: 8.514693."""

I need to compute the final displacement vector starting from a given point, summing movements in the east-west direction for x (where east is positive) and in the north-south direction for y (north is positive). It looks like the majority of the movements are in the southern direction, so I need to keep that in mind. I'll start by initializing my variables x and y to zero. Then, I'll sum the movements to find the final vector.**Calculating movements step-by-step**

I'm laying out movements in a series of calculations. Each step shows the changes in x and y coordinates based on directional movements. For example, moving 0.75 south updates y to -0.75, while moving 0.25 west adjusts x to -0.25. I continue this process, progressively adding or subtracting values based on the direction of movement. After all the steps, I’ll summarize the final coordinates at the end to determine the overall displacement vector.**Calculating final distance**

I've reached the end of my calculations, with final coordinates at (5.0, -5.5). To find the distance, I need to apply the Pythagorean theorem: it involves computing the square root of the sum of the squares of the coordinates. So, I calculate the distance as sqrt(25 + 30.25), which gives me approximately 7.433. I figure it's reasonable to round to three decimal places, so my final answer will be 7.433."

I need to compute the net displacement from the start to the end position by summing the movements in the east-west direction and the north-south direction. I’ll treat positive values as east for x and north for y. It makes sense to start tracking this step by step, so I’m initializing x and y to zero. Then I can tally the movements in both directions from there!**Summarizing displacement steps**

I’m listing out the movement steps to calculate the net displacement. First, I’ll track the movements east and north by updating my x and y coordinates at each step. For instance, moving 0.75 east adds 0.75 to x, and moving 0.25 north adds 0.25 to y. I’ll continue this for all steps to keep a detailed tally, noting both positive and negative displacements as I progress through the journey. Each movement will build on the previous totals!**Calculating final distance**

I’m finalizing the coordinates after completing all the movement steps. The final position is (7.5, 2.25), so I need to calculate the distance using the formula: distance = sqrt(x^2 + y^2). I’ll compute 7.5^2 and 2.25^2, then sum them. After a little back-and-forth with calculating the square root, I'm getting around 7.8302. I think rounding this to three decimal places is best. So, the final answer will be: ""Final Answer: 7.830."""
