The task is to calculate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and end of a given path described in text.

## Step 2: Break down the path into movements
The path is described as a series of movements in the cardinal directions (east, north, west, south) with specified distances.

## Step 3: Sum the movements in the east and north directions
To find the final position relative to the start, we need to sum all the eastward movements and all the northward movements separately, and then subtract the sum of westward movements from the sum of eastward movements, and the sum of southward movements from the sum of northward movements.
