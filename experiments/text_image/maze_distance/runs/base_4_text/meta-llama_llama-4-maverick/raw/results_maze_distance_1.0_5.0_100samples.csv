First, let's add up all the movements in the west direction: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 2.25 units.

## Step 2: Calculate the total movement in the east direction
Now, let's add up all the movements in the east direction: 0.25 units.

## Step 3: Calculate the net movement in the west direction
To find the net westward movement, subtract the total eastward movement from the total westward movement: 2.25 - 0.25 = 2 units.

Total east = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 1.0 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.75 = 3.5
Total south = 0.25 - 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 - 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.5
Total west = 0.25
Net east = Total east - Total west = 3.5 - 0.25 = 3."
