## Step 3: Calculate the total eastward displacement
Let's sum the eastward movements: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 - 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 1.0"

Total west = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 3 units

The problem asks to estimate the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the start and the end of a given path within a square boundary.

## Step 2: Break down the path into its north-south and east-west components
To calculate the Euclidean distance, we need to determine the net displacement in the north-south and east-west directions.

## Step 3: Calculate the net northward displacement
Let's add up the northward movements: 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 4."
